StarterPetitionUpdate,29715353,2021-10-13T04:00:09.000Z,,dc-entertainment-remove-amber-heard-from-aquaman-2,Appeal denied!,"<p>Amber Heard has tried at least three times to have Johnny Depp’s defamation suit against her dismissed. Her dismissal attempts have seemed endless, but those attempts might have come to an end.</p>
<p>Judge Penney Azcarate has handed down a ruling that refused to allow Amber Heard’s lawyers to petition the Virginia Supreme Court to become involved in the case. Basically, Heard wanted the Supreme Court to throw out Depp’s defamation case because he lost the UK libel suit against the Sun tabloid, which labeled him a Wife Beater.</p>
<p>Judge Azcarate had previously ruled against Heard’s dismissal attempt, so Heard tried to go over the judge’s head and have the Supreme Court do it instead. It didn’t work.</p>
<p>If Heard’s appeal had been approved, it would have meant the end of Depp’s defamation suit against her.</p>
<p>Filed in March 2019, Depp’s defamation suit contends that Heard defamed him when she wrote an op-ed describing herself as a domestic abuse survivor. The op-ed didn’t name Depp, but followed months of Heard’s allegations that he had abused her.</p>
<p>Depp lost his role in Disney’s Pirates of the Caribbean franchise four days after the op-ed came out. Depp is asking for $50 million in damages.</p>
<p>Not to be outdone, Heard has filed a counterclaim against Depp asking for $100 million, alleging that Depp orchestrated a smear campaign against her – including allegations that Depp is/was responsible for this petition's creation. I remain ready and able to prove that he had nothing to do with it.</p>
<p>The trial is set for spring/summer 2022. I’m keeping my schedule flexible in case they call me.</p>",,,,,against

<p>The Health and Safety board in the UK are investigating after a stunt incident damaged Jason Momoa's eye. Safety tips were removed from a prop that Amber Heard was using and she hit him [Momoa] with it.</p>
<p>Was she unaware of the missing safety tip? Did she not care? Did Momoa say or do something that angered her? Or was she just too inept to be able to use the prop correctly?</p>
<p>Whatever the case, it seems nobody is safe from being hurt by Amber Heard.</p>
<p>Talk about an insurance nightmare. </p>
<p>I have to wonder if the safety of having her continue on the project is the subject of conversation right now. That's just one more reason she should be removed from the film.</p>","{'id': '225992326', 'petitionMedium': {'url': '//assets.change.org/photos/6/bv/xa/XDBVXaMenGYPtYc-800x450-noPad.jpg?1633613312', 'processing': False}}",,,,against

StarterPetitionUpdate,29650692,2021-09-26T00:38:23.000Z,,dc-entertainment-remove-amber-heard-from-aquaman-2,Why Amber Heard lied and accused Johnny,"<p>Throughout the time that this petition has existed, I’ve provided links to all sorts of evidence supporting the notion that Amber Heard abused Johnny Depp and then accused him of abuse.</p>
<p>First, there was the <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fK2kADXcbeY&amp;ab_channel=SecondPoster"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">audiotape where Heard admits to punching Johnny Depp repeatedly</a>.<br>“I was hitting you.”</p>
<p>And there’s the audiotape where she admits to cutting off his finger –<br>“I never meant to hurt him! I didn’t mean to do it!” <a href=""https://twitter.com/LyttleWyng/status/1441915367039844353"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">HERE</a>’s a quick snap of that.</p>
<p>But if hearing that she abused Johnny Depp in her own words isn’t enough to convince you that her victim act is just that, an act, there’s <a href=""https://twitter.com/Marussia15/status/1426161911117324288"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">this audio of Amber Heard telling Johnny Depp why she lied and accused him of abusing her</a>. It’s not new, but it’s circulating lately so I thought I’d share it with you again. You may not have heard it before, or there might have been new evidence that’s got you ready for another listen. It’s the truth, and it’s out there. In print, in audio, online, just about everywhere.</p>
<p>But, hey. Don’t believe the mass media. They’re just in it for the money.</p>
<p>Don’t believe me. I’m obviously biased. I think Amber Heard should be sitting in an Australian jail for cutting Johnny’s finger off.</p>
<p>Believe your own ears. Heard says it herself. Admits it, tries to weasel her way out of blame by pointing the finger at somebody else, as per usual. But she says it. All you have to do is listen.</p>
<p>Or, if you can’t be arsed to listen to the whole thing, here’s the transcription:</p>
<p>“Laura Wasser had proposed that I need to… not proposed, I’m sorry, said that I would have to leave. That I’d be kicked out. I’d be evicted. So Rock and Josh and everybody, evicted in 21 days.</p>
<p>“No,” Johnny answered that fear, telling Amber that she’d have however long she needed to get her feet back up underneath her. “But I told you the last time we talked, told you that you were fine, that you stay there two, three, fucking four months, whatever. Just fucking figure it out. We’ll figure it out. You stay there, you’ll be comf-“</p>
<p>“I got that too,” She interrupted him.</p>
<p>“Be in your home,” he tried to assure her.</p>
<p>“No,” She insists. “I thought that too. They told me 21 days. THAT IS PART OF WHY I ACCUSED YOU OF DOING THAT.”</p>
<p>There you have it. In her own words, from her own mouth. Amber Heard accused Johnny Depp of abusing her so that she and her friends could stay in the penthouses at the Eastern Columbia Building. Not because he actually abused her. Not because she was afraid of him. Because she didn’t want to lose the apartment. Never mind that she had her own place, her dad’s place, friends’ places and countless other places she could have landed, she insists that she would have been homeless if she had to leave the ECB, so she had no choice but to lie about Johnny Depp and accuse him of domestic abuse.</p>
<p>Oh, please.</p>
<p>If this doesn’t convince you that she’s full of it, I don’t know what else to tell you. Either you’re stunned by her beauty (snark mode off), you’re too stubborn to believe the truth when it’s placed in front of you on a silver platter, or you’re a troll hell bent on mischief.</p>

StarterPetitionUpdate,29579670,2021-09-09T14:53:24.000Z,,dc-entertainment-remove-amber-heard-from-aquaman-2,Mental Health Evaluation for Amber Heard?,"<p>Team Depp is seeking to compel Ms. Heard to undergo an independent mental examination. This is a Rule 4:10 Motion for an Independent Mental Examination.</p>
<p>The reason for the request is that Heard is claiming that Depp’s alleged abuse left her with damages to her reputation and embarrassment and humiliation, as well as emotional damage. That opens the door for Team Depp to question exactly what Heard’s emotional state was at the time, and what it still is, ongoing. It is absolutely relevant and timely, so an independent mental health evaluation is most definitely called for.</p>
<p>Team Heard will undoubtedly fight against the evaluation, pulling out all stops to keep it from happening. There are, however, many in the public that think that Heard should be evaluated. They think that if she’s properly diagnosed, perhaps she can begin to get some help.</p>
<p>Barring that, there are those that think that if nothing else, perhaps it’s possible that baby Oonagh can be removed from the care of a potentially dangerous parent and placed in a safer environment. There has been a great deal of concern expressed for the safety of the child, especially lately, with pictures surfacing that seemingly show Heard getting behind the wheel to drive while intoxicated.</p>

StarterPetitionUpdate,29485087,2021-08-19T15:47:32.000Z,,dc-entertainment-remove-amber-heard-from-aquaman-2,Depp gets legal victory,"<p>Johnny Depp was handed a legal win on Tuesday when a Virginia judge refused to dismiss his $50 million defamation lawsuit against ex-wife Amber Heard.</p>
<p>Depp is suing Heard for defamation following an op-ed the actress published in the Washington Post claiming to have been the victim of domestic abuse. She didn’t directly name Depp, but it’s pretty obvious who she’s talking about, especially after communications arose between Heard and the ACLU discussing that very matter.</p>
<p>Heard sought to dismiss Depp’s defamation suit on the grounds that a similar libel lawsuit Depp filed against the U.K. paper The Sun had been tossed in that country. Basically, Heard wanted the American defamation suit thrown out because Johnny lost the UK libel suit against the Sun.</p>
<p>Judge Penney Azcarate, however, remained unconvinced. “Defendant argues she was in privity with The Sun because they both had the same interest in the case,” Azcarate wrote. “The Sun’s interests were based on whether the statements the newspaper published were false. Defendant’s interests relate to whether the statements she published were false.”</p>
<p>In other words, no. The UK libel suit wasn’t about Amber Heard. It was about whether or not the Sun believed what Heard told them.</p>
<p>The American defamation suit is about whether or not Amber is lying when she says that she was abused at the hands of Johnny Depp, an assertion she’s repeated doggedly since the couple split. Entirely different animal.</p>
<p>So, as of right now, Johnny Depp’s defamation suit can continue as scheduled.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Johnny Depp is receiving awards in different countries for his body of work, recent work, and ongoing projects. Anybody who said that Johnny Depp was over is seriously mistaken.</p>
<p>Heard, on the other hand, has no scheduled projects on her <a href=""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1720028/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">IMDB</a> page. Perhaps she plans to spend time being a mother to her recently acquired baby daughter. Nothing wrong with that at all. A precious new life is a gift that deserves to be taken care of with the very best of intentions.</p>
<p>Or Heard has fried all her bridges in Hollywood.</p>
<p>Whatever the reason, Heard’s film dance card is decidedly bare except for her dubious involvement with Aquaman 2 and a project called “Run away with me” that’s been languishing in limbo for years.</p>

StarterPetitionUpdate,29399423,2021-07-30T19:26:34.000Z,,dc-entertainment-remove-amber-heard-from-aquaman-2,Efforts to have Heard removed from AM2 carried no water,"<p>So says producer Peter Safran when asked whether or not the social media campaign by Johnny Depp fans for Amber Heard’s removal from the DC sequel ever had any influence on the production and their casting decisions.</p>
<p>“I don’t think we’re ever going to react to, honestly, pure fan pressure,” said Safran. “You gotta do what’s best for the movie.”</p>
<p>If Safran and the AM2 franchise had any idea what was best for the movie, they would dump a known domestic abuser the instant audio came out with Heard admitting in her own words to abusing Johnny Depp. Any man would have been canned on the spot. Anybody else would have been fired. Period. Yet here’s Amber Heard, acting like she’s bulletproof, with support from inside the industry.</p>
<p>What a travesty.</p>
<p>But what’s funny is that Safran neglects to mention the petition to remove Amber Heard from AM2 petition, which carries almost 2 million signatures from consumers who promise to boycott the movie if she’s in it. And, despite efforts to silence the petition, more and more people sign it every day.</p>
<p>Likewise, the apparent inclusion of Heard in AM2 has re-ignited the #JusticeForJohnnyDepp crew on Twitter again. There’s a whole world of people out here that don’t want to see Amber Heard in AM2, and it’s not just rabid Johnny Depp fans, as the slanted media would have you believe. A great many people opposing Amber Heard are survivors of domestic abuse who are outraged that Johnny Depp, the victim of domestic abuse, is still being treated like a pariah while his abuser continues to work in films.</p>
<p>In fact, a great many of them really didn’t care for Johnny Depp one way or another, but were outraged that there’s such a biased double standard when it comes to male victims of domestic abuse, and that Depp continues to face false allegations of domestic abuse when he is, in fact, the victim.</p>
<p>Like the front page of this petition says, men are victims of domestic abuse, just like women. This must be recognized, and action must be taken to prevent a known abuser from being celebrated within the entertainment industry.</p>
<p>At this time, it appears that Amber Heard is, indeed, involved with AM2. But we don’t know in what capacity, or to what extent. She could be the costar from start to finish, or she could be cast in just a few scenes that could easily be reshot after some judicial decisions are made about her. After all, Johnny Depp was removed from FB3 after filming already started. The same thing could happen to Heard after court happens.</p>
<p>Let’s not forget, after all, that she’s not just facing Johnny Depp in court for Defamation. She’s also being investigated by the FBI, and it Australia for perjury.</p>
<p>Her legal woes aren’t “just” civil. They’re also criminal.</p>
<p>So she and her cohorts can pooh-pooh the internet and the millions of people out here in the real world that are rallying against her, but her world might not be all roses and sunshine like she makes it out to be. There could be serious legal and financial ramifications that she’ll have to face, not the least of which is a massive flop when those millions of people boycott AM2.</p>
<p>We’ll have to wait and see what becomes of AM2, Heard’s legal issues, and her career. But I, for one, don’t see a thriving future for her in Hollywood moving forward. She got the AM franchise when she was married to Johnny Depp, sure. But her dance card isn’t looking too good otherwise. There are no new projects listed for her on her IMDB page, and the rumor mill isn’t churning out anything of merit.</p>
<p>Heard might be mugging for selfies now, but I’m pretty sure she’ll be laughing out the other side of her face when the dust settles.</p>
<p>Time will tell.</p>
<p>What do you think? Is she getting away with it footloose and fancy-free? Or is the end about to catch up with her? Drop by Twitter and let us know what you think.</p>

StarterPetitionUpdate,29319766,2021-07-11T12:57:04.000Z,,dc-entertainment-remove-amber-heard-from-aquaman-2,Depp fans call for boycott,"<p>Fans of Johnny Depp are furious that the actor has been fired from two major movie franchises while his abusive ex continues to work. </p>
<p>Depp has lost roles in the Pirates of the Caribbean and Fantastic Beasts movie franchises because of allegations by his ex-wife Amber Heard that he was violent during their tumultuous marriage. Meanwhile, Heard is apparently still involved with the Aquaman movie franchise opposite Jason Momoa. </p>
<p>Now, Depp fans have taken to social media in a last-ditch bid to get the actress fired from Aquaman 2, Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom and get Depp rehired to both Pirates and Fantastic Beasts. </p>
<p>If that doesn't happen, scores of fans have promised to boycott Aquaman 2, as well as anything else put out by Warner Bros due to the injustice. </p>
<p>I don't think fans need to worry, however. Amber Heard is still in AM2 because she had a preexisting contract, not because of any new negotiations. And, judging by Heard's IMDB, she's got nothing new coming up. And it's highly unlikely that she will get many new film projects, if any. Not only are there the ongoing legal woes with Depp, Heard was heard on tape admitting to abusing Depp without remorse.</p>
<p>Heard also has a history of domestic violence, including an arrest for violence against her ex-wife Tasya Van Ree. </p>
<p>There is an outcry among the public saying that if a man had committed these acts, with a history of domestic violence, he would have received much harsher penalties in Hollywood. Just look at what's happened to Johnny Depp based on unsubstantiated accusations.</p>
<p>I think things are going to turn around. I think Heard will face repercussions for her actions, despite her recently acquired motherhood. The public doesn't want to see her in movies, as her recent flop, Gully might testify to. And, sooner or later, the studios are going to have to pay attention. It's the public that pays for tickets. Or, in this case, it's the public who don't. </p>
<p>Heard has a history of domestic abuse. </p>
<p>Johnny Depp is one of the most beloved figures in Hollywood, with a loyal fan base and a history of being a genuinely nice guy. He'll continue to work, and, once he's cleared his name, this nasty business with his ex will be put firmly in his rear view mirror. </p>
<p>Heard may very well never work in Hollywood again.</p>
<p>We'll have to wait and see.</p>
<p>What do you think? Will Depp rebound while Heard fades into oblivion, or will she continue to beg, borrow and connive her way into more movies? Drop by Twitter and let us know.</p>","{'id': '225747787', 'petitionMedium': {'url': '//assets.change.org/photos/8/nk/qy/ThNKqyQRrEyoxOq-800x450-noPad.jpg?1626008227', 'processing': False}}",,,,against
StarterPetitionUpdate,29310494,2021-07-08T21:48:03.000Z,,dc-entertainment-remove-amber-heard-from-aquaman-2,More calls to fire Amber Heard from AM2,"<p>After it was revealed that work on the next Aquaman sequel had officially commenced, supporters of Johnny Depp relaunched a new Twitter campaign against Amber Heard.</p>
<p>Director James Wan revealed on Monday that production for Aquaman: The Lost Kingdom has begun, 18 months ahead of its December 2022 release date. Wan, who also helmed 2018’s Aquaman, uploaded a photograph of a clapperboard in an ice cave on Instagram with the phrase “day one.”</p>
<p>Instantly, the hashtag #JusticeforJohnnyDepp began trending on Twitter, as Johnny Depp fans voiced their displeasure that Heard is still potentially involved with the project.</p>
<p>There remains doubt among the Twitterverse about the extent of Heard's involvement, however, since she hasn't posted anything on social media about filming. For Aquaman, she posted behind the scenes stuff practically every other day. This time around, nothing. </p>
<p>She's posted plenty from London, with her walking around, visiting restaurants and practicing her abysmal British wannabe accent, but nothing about filming. So some detractors wonder if she's really even involved at all. </p>
<p>But let's assume for the sake of conversation that she is. there are a LOT of people that aren't happy about it. Almost 2 million that I could point at right here on this petition, and there are thousands more out there. Maybe millions. We'll have to wait until December 2022 to find out the extent of Heard's involvement</p>
<p>In the meantime, there's still the matter of Johnny Depp's defamation suit. It remains to be seen what effect the outcome will have on AM2, and on Heard's career, such as it is.</p>
<p>The lawsuit will be heard in April 2022.</p>

One indication of that is that he’s got more than 10 million followers on Instagram, and that number continues to rise. And that’s after sharing only 18 posts.</p>
<p>Another indication of Depp’ popularity is a veritable army of supporters on twitter who continue to share in the actor’s fight to clear his name.</p>
<p>Amber Heard, meanwhile, barely has 4 million followers on Instagram, where she is recently posting pictures and videos of herself with her newly acquired baby.</p>
<p>Depp’s character prior to Heard’s accusations is that of a kind, gentle, loving and generous fellow, and that’s the impression that continues to shine through.</p>
<p>Heard’s character prior to her relationship with Depp is that of someone who’s been arrested for domestic violence with a history of shady motives, and that’s the impression that’s hanging around her, despite new motherhood.</p>
<p>Heard supporters say that Heard’s a mommy now, so the whole thing with Depp should be dropped, and that his supporters should move on. Depp’s supporters, however, insist that he deserves to have his name cleared, and that she should face justice for her misdeeds whether she’s a new mom or not.</p>
<p>Regardless of public opinion either way, the two actors will square off early next year in a defamation case that Depp leveled against Heard after she labeled him as her abuser repeatedly after a divorce settlement that included an NDA.</p>
<p>We’ll just have to wait and see how that goes. And we’ll have to wait and see which of the two really is ready to put the issue to bed and move on, whichever way it comes out.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Heard insists that she’s involved in Aquaman 2, while Depp and his production company, Infinitum Nihil, have dozens of projects in the works.</p>

StarterPetitionUpdate,29288233,2021-07-03T15:22:51.000Z,,dc-entertainment-remove-amber-heard-from-aquaman-2,Baby Backlash,"<p>Two days ago, Amber Heard announced that she has become the mother of a daughter named Oonagh Paige Heard via surrogate. In her announcement, months after the baby’s birth, Heard said: that baby Oonagh is ‘the beginning of the rest of my life’. And the backlash was immediate.</p>
<p>Now, there’s an article titled: Becoming a mother isn’t all about you, Amber Heard. In it, author Amanda Platell calls Heard to task, saying:</p>
<p>“Sorry, what? How about the beginning of someone else’s life? Having a child, Amber, is not about you. It’s about the tiny, helpless person you have chosen to bring into the world. Becoming a mother is the most selfless thing a woman can do. Forgive me if I have my lingering doubts that Amber understands that.”</p>
<p>And many Twitter denizens tend to agree. “Her post was compete all about her,” writes one sceptic. “She can’t hide her narcissism.”</p>
<p>“Me, me, me Heard,” says another.</p>
<p>One Twitter denizen is quick to point out that although the baby was born in April, Heard still hasn’t updated her twitter bio. As of this writing, Heard’s bio says that she’s a(n) “Actor and activist, semi-professional disruptor, ice cream advocate and shameless teacup Yorkie-lover.” Not a word about being a devoted mommy to a sweet little angel.</p>
<p>They get that Heard might have wanted some private time with baby Oonagh before making an announcement to the world, but she’s let the cat out of the bag now, and still not a word in her Twitter bio about her overwhelming joy at welcoming her new bouncing bundle of joy.</p>
<p>Likewise, there’s no category for Heard being a mother on her Instagram account. Just the same tired old categories that have been up forever.</p>
<p>One might argue that she’s too busy to bother with such trivialities, but she hasn’t been too busy to post pictures of herself, or to post the announcement itself.</p>
<p>One might, then, wonder where Heard’s priorities lie.</p>
<p>The day Oonagh was born, Heard posted a video of herself crawling around on the beach in a flimsy sundress, babbling about death threats. One Twitter user was quick to say: “So much concern for her new baby and the woman who actually birthed it.”</p>
<p>Another posted the video from that day with the caption: “The day her baby was born. On the beach Not with her child or surrogate.”</p>
<p>Overwhelmingly, the majority of the comments on Twitter show concern for a baby being raised by someone with a history of and arrest for domestic violence, posting the hashtag: #SaveBabyHeard.</p>
<p>While this concern is touching, Heard’s history of violence is against adults. She has no public record of a history of violence against children. And, while having a newborn can be a stressful and trying time, it’s almost certain that Heard has a network of nannies and family upon whom she can lean to do most of the heavy lifting. After all, Heard is in London, reportedly filming right now, and there’s no evidence that the baby is with her. There have been lots of photos and videos of Heard out and about in London, but none of them show evidence that she’s got the baby along for the ride. So somebody’s looking after little Oonagh.</p>
<p>So, not to worry. There are probably enough people in baby Oonagh’s life to ensure that she’ll grow up safe and happy. Let's all wish little Oonagh the very best that life has to offer.</p>

<p>Depp fans and abuse survivors flooded both of <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/creepypuppet/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">Wan's Instagram</a> messages with so many calls for Amber Heard to be removed from Aquaman 2 that he had to restrict his comments. </p>
<p>Also, one brave fan placed a ""Justice for Johnny Depp"" poster outside the Warner Bros studio outside London as a reminder that millions of people have sworn to boycott the film vehemently if and when it comes out. </p>
<p>People aren't soon to forget that Johnny Depp was removed from the Pirates franchise and fired from Fantastic Beasts while his abuser continues to work. It's a double standard that should and must be rectified.</p>
<p>Aquaman 2 is set to be released in December, 2022. </p>

StarterPetitionUpdate,29159471,2021-06-04T15:39:25.000Z,,dc-entertainment-remove-amber-heard-from-aquaman-2,Heard's Australian Visa may be suspended,"<p>Is Amber Heard still in Aquaman 2? Nobody knows for sure, including possibly Heard herself. She hasn't shared any pre-production tidbits like she did when gearing up for the first one. No costume previews, no workout videos with studio professionals, hada. Her timelines are instead filled with old pictures of herself in precarious positions with questionable attire. </p>
<p>Even IF Warner Bros are still considering Heard for the film, there might be a huge monkey wrench set to be thrown into the works. Heard might lose her Visa to enter Australia, where the first one was filmed (and the second likely will be, too).</p>
<p>Heard, you see, is currently under investigation by the Australian department of agriculture for circumstances surrounding the time when Heard smuggled two teacup Yorkies into the country.</p>
<p>“The department is investigating if any criminal offences under Commonwealth legislation have been committed relating to the testimony provided to the High Court in London. Because of the nature of those enquiries we are unable to provide a timeline,” a departmental spokesperson told news.com.au late last year.</p>
<p>“The Department of Home Affairs has the right to reject any application if the individual is under an investigation by our government,” a representative told us. “Although we cannot go into the specifics of Ms Heard’s case, it is very much a possibility that VISA application may be put on hold until the investigation is over. It just depends of the severity of the offence.”</p>
<p>Providing a false document on entry to Australia under the Migration Act is a serious offence that attracts a maximum penalty of 12 months jail and a fine of $10,200. Furthermore, Heard didn’t just lie on her documents, she also lied to the judge and perjury is a far more serious offence and the maximum penalty is 14 years in jail.</p>
<p>She squeaked out of charges at the time, but those events are being investigated. So it's very possible that her application to travel to Australia will be denied, leaving Heard out in the cold for any filming that takes place there.</p>
<p>Is Heard important enough to the film for them to arrange for alternate locations this late in the game? That's questionable, but we'll have to wait and see. </p>
<p>Aquaman 2 is slated to start filming either this month or next (June or July 2021). </p>

StarterPetitionUpdate,29138587,2021-05-31T17:31:22.000Z,,dc-entertainment-remove-amber-heard-from-aquaman-2,Heard's lawyer denies perjury investigation,"<p>Not long ago, it was revealed that the <a href=""https://insidethemagic.net/2021/05/amber-heard-lapd-probe-perjury-rwb1/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">LAPD</a> has become involved with investigating Amber Heard for <a href=""https://insidethemagic.net/2021/05/amber-heard-lapd-probe-perjury-rwb1/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">perjury</a>. Well, her lawyer says no.</p>
<p>The “Aquaman” star’s lawyer said the Los Angeles Police Department is not looking into if she faked injuries during an alleged altercation between herself and ex-husband Johnny Depp during a hearing in his case against her. The statute of limitations has run out for that incident to be investigated, she insists. </p>
<p>I'm no law expert, I'll admit, but I've heard it said that it's not 3 years from the date of the incident that constitutes the statute. They say that the clock starts ticking when the authorities become aware of the perjury. </p>
<p>I don't know which scenario is true, but we'll see.</p>
<p>It seems to me, though, that if the statute of limitations were up, the LAPD wouldn't bother starting an investigation, and they know a lot more about it than me. </p>
<p>We can add this investigation, if there is one, to the pile of Heard's legal woes. She's reportedly still under investigation for <a href=""https://www.nzherald.co.nz/entertainment/amber-heard-facing-perjury-charges-in-australia-over-dog-smuggling/WTF4PC42UJM5PUWNMDPWFWLMKE/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">perjury in Australia</a> regarding an incident where she smuggled the couple's dogs into the country in violation of Australia's bio-laws. </p>
<p>And let's not forget Johnny Depp's case against her for defamation, as if we could forget. There are hearings for motions scheduled along the way, but the main event is due to start in April of 2022. That's when it's really going to hit the fan.</p>
<p>If the public thought that the libel case against the Sun was a circus, they haven't seen anything yet. The only evidence that was relevant in the Sun case was admitted as it related to the libel case. </p>
<p>In the Defamation case, EVERYTHING comes into play. And make no mistake, there's evidence we haven't even heard of yet. The Eastern Columbia building, where the couple lived, has CCtv security cameras that capture everything. There are stories about Heard chasing Depp out into the hall. If that happened, there's footage of it. Not to mention whatever men might have visited Heard in the penthouse when Depp was away working. Including what times they arrived and left. </p>
<p>Plus, there's the incident where Heard accused Depp of spilling wine all up and down the hallway in a fit of rage. If that happened, it'll be on camera, too. If not, the unblinking eye of the camera will show the truth of what happened that night. Including who was where, and when. Did the other penthouse denizens pass Depp's security to get into PH3? If not, they had to have come in through the adjoining penthouse, which screams setup, and blatantly contradicts their testimony.</p>
<p>Let's see those Toronto tapes. </p>
<p>Let's hear more of those recorded conversations. </p>
<p>Let's see it ALL. </p>
<p>Oh, yes. There's so much more to come. </p>
<p>Point being, Heard's legal woes might not be over with Johnny's defamation case, win or lose. She still stands to face investigations in two countries for statements her mouth made that reality might not be able to back up</p>

There's no real description of what Heard's role in it is. The trailer only shows snippets of her screaming at the police and apparently pole dancing. It's hard to tell from that.</p>
<p>In the meantime, the public are making their opinions known about a film with Heard in it, as there are far more dislikes clicked for the trailer than likes Don't take my word for it.

According to those sources, Heard has wanted to become involved with the Harry Potter franchise for some time, but wouldn’t broach the idea as long as ex-husband Johnny Depp was involved. Now that he’s been booted, she has the freedom to angle for a role.</p>
<p>They didn’t say what role Heard might be after, or even what part of the franchise she’s interested in. It could be a future film, or a highly anticipated Harry Potter series rumored to be coming our way via HBO. Who knows?</p>
<p>A series would give her potential longevity instead of a single movie appearance, and it would maintain some distance from the elements of the franchise that Johnny Depp was associated with.</p>
<p>The question is whether or not Warmer Bros wants to continue working with Heard, as her relationship with the upcoming Aquaman sequel is dubious at best. According to <a href=""https://poptopic.com.au/rumour/amber-heard-allegedly-has-not-been-contacted-about-aquaman-2/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">Poptopik</a>, she allegedly hasn’t even been called for AM2, and it’s supposed to start filming in just over a month.

<p>Amber Heard said: ""I had bruised ribs, bruises all over my body (...), two blue eyes, a broken nose, a cracked lip"" But these photos show Heard with no marks on her and a pristine skin. No bruises where those broken ribs would have been, no busted lip, and no contusions on her face that would be evident after such a savage beating.</p>
<p>BILD asked emergency phisician Prof. Peter Sefrin, member of the DKR Presidium: ""Both a broken nose and bruised ribs cause very severe pain. You don't necessarily see it on the outside, but the nose has to be operated if it's broken, a bruised rib only starts to heal after 14 days.""</p>
<p>NOTABLE: There is no medical certificate or X-rays of the broken nose from the incident of the alleged abuse on Dec 15th, 2015.<br>Amber's private nurse , who she called in two days after the incident, testified at the time that she could not see any visible injuries.</p>
<p>BILD asked Amber's Attorney Elaine Bredehoft to comment. She said Bild should look into the London Court ruling that supports AMber's account of the mistreatment and her explanation for contradiction of going onto private trip shortly afterwards: ""All the evidence has already been fully considered"".</p>
<p>Trouble is, these photos weren’t available at the London trial, or the outcome might have been very different. They will be available for the VA defamation trial, though.</p>
<p>In related news, there might be some collusion between the ACLU and Amber Heard over making that WaMo OpEd look like it wasn’t supposed to be about Johnny Depp, though it clearly was.</p>

<p>Originally reported in the German news outlet BILD, the story is being picked up and spread around by American sources as well. This is good news in and of itself. </p>
<p>The press so far has been decidedly pro-Heard, posting every little thing she says and does, painting her in a favorable light, while largely refusing to print anything remotely favorable to Heard's ex husband, Johnny Depp.</p>
<p>The two are embroiled in litigation that's already gone on as many as 3 years, and promises to continue into years to come. The two will face off in court in Fairfax, VA starting in April of 2022 in Johnny Depp's defamation suit against Heard. There's no telling how long that will take to play out. </p>
<p>One thing's for sure, though, it's going to be informative. CCTV footage of everything that happens in the hallways of the Eastern Columbia building in LA is recorded by security cameras. That, of course, is where the couple lived at the time of their explosive falling out. So, Heard's claims of Depp's behavior could very bell be confirmed or debunked by the building's own security cameras. </p>
<p>One claim has already been given a new light. Bodycam footage from two of the officers responding to 911 calls was recently released, showing no damage to the apartment, including the door, that Heard had previously claimed. </p>
<p>It remains to be seen what evidence will be forthcoming for the defamation trial, but I'm willing to bet it'll be newsworthy.</p>
<p>And with the media showing a willingness to report stories that may favor Depp, we'll be able to follow it in the media. Hopefully by then, it'll be completely acceptable to cover pro-Depp stories as well. </p>

This information has struck a lot of Johnny Depp supporters hard, because it seems like she can get away with whatever she wants and keep getting roles in blockbuster films. </p>
<p>But there's more to the story.</p>
<p>For one thing, there are millions of people bombarding @WBPictures on Twitter with their disdain for this decision. Amber Heard seems to get away with being this massive abuser and doesn't get fired, while Johnny Depp, who is overwhelmingly innnocent, gets canned from two major franchises. The Travesty! These millions promise to #BoycottAquaman2 and there are whispers of demonstrations at both the filming locations and the movie's premiers in assorted countries. </p>
<p>So things don't look so hot for WB for hiring Amber Heard back after reportedly buying out her contract so that she wouldn't be in it.</p>
<p>Plus, there are still legal woes plaguing Amber Heard. And, no. I don't just mean the defamation case brought against her buy Johnny Depp, which is set to begin in April of 2022.</p>
<p>Nope. I'm talking about Amber Heard reportedly being investigated by the Australian government for perjury in association with smuggling two dogs into Australia contrary to Oz's biosecurity laws. </p>
<p>That's nothing new, I know. It's been going around for years that they're looking at her for that, seemingly with no end in sight.</p>
<p>What's new is a claim by a Youbuter named <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=That+umbrella+guy"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">That Umbrella Guy</a> that the FBI has been contacted to assist with the investigation. If that's true, it puts things in a whole different light. The penalty for perjury in Australia could land Heard as many as 14 years in jail, hefty fines, and possibly being banned from Australia for a number of years. </p>
<p>While it's disturbingly unlikely that Heard will do any jail time (though many of her detractors hope she will), being banned from the country could affect filming schedules from any movie being produced there.</p>
<p>Including Aquaman 2.</p>
<p>It's been said by cast and crew that AM2 will begin filming in London in June, 2021, but that's likely for the indoor scenes. It's very possible that the outside scenes will be filmed in Australia, like they were for AM1.</p>
<p>If that's the case, Heard would not be able to film in Australia. Granted, there may be legal loopholes they can jump through to make it possible, since the film is a preexisting project, or some such, but it presents an ever-growing headache for any studio that considers working with her in the future. Time will have to tell that tale.</p>
<p>Regardless, whatever happens in court, and in Australia, Johnny Depp's popularity and productivity continue to soar, while Heard's public opinion seems to be waning. </p>
<p>Will Heard be able to repair her public image? A LOT of people, myself included, doubt it sincerely, but we'll have to wait and see what happens.</p>

She says that the UK trial established that: ""Mr Depp committed domestic violence against Ms Heard on many occasions, causing her to fear for her life"".<br>Depp famously lost his slander case against NGN newsgroup and the Sun tabloid, who labeled him as a “wife beater.” He was also denied the chance to file an appeal to overturn the ruling. That, Heard insists, is grounds to dismiss his $50 million defamation suit against her.<br>It continued: ""Depp cannot relitigate these factual issues, and as a result of their preclusion, he cannot claim that the statements are false and 'actionable' under Virginia defamation law, so his claims are barred as a matter of law.""</p>
<p>The filing from the Aquaman actress's team of lawyers adds: ""Therefore, as a matter of law, Depp cannot prevail on any of his claims, and Depp's complaint against Ms Heard should be dismissed in its entirety.""</p>
<p>Heard has requested a hearing next month in front of a judge in an effort to put a stop to the lawsuit. Again. This marks perhaps half a dozen attempts on Heard’s part to have Depp’s slander case against her dismissed. All previous attempts have been denied, and this one likely will be, too.</p>
<p>The Sun case wasn’t between Depp and Heard, remember. It was against Depp and the Sun. Heard was just a witness. And “Just because the Sun says so” isn’t a good enough reason to throw out a lawsuit.</p>
<p>Depp’s legal team haven’t yet responded to Heard’s latest filing, but it’s unlikely that her request to have his suit thrown out will succeed.</p>
<p>The case is due to be heard in Fairfax, VA in April of 2022.</p>

That, Heard insists, is grounds to dismiss his $50 million defamation suit against her.<br>It continued: ""Depp cannot relitigate these factual issues, and as a result of their preclusion, he cannot claim that the statements are false and 'actionable' under Virginia defamation law, so his claims are barred as a matter of law.""</p>
<p>The filing from the Aquaman actress's team of lawyers adds: ""Therefore, as a matter of law, Depp cannot prevail on any of his claims, and Depp's complaint against Ms Heard should be dismissed in its entirety.""</p>
<p>Heard has requested a hearing next month in front of a judge in an effort to put a stop to the lawsuit. Again. This marks perhaps half a dozen attempts on Heard’s part to have Depp’s slander case against her dismissed. All previous attempts have been denied, and this one likely will be, too.</p>
<p>The Sun case wasn’t between Depp and Heard, remember. It was against Depp and the Sun. Heard was just a witness. And “Just because the Sun says so” isn’t a good enough reason to throw out a lawsuit.</p>
<p>Depp’s legal team haven’t yet responded to Heard’s latest filing, but it’s unlikely that her request to have his suit thrown out will succeed.</p>
<p>The case is due to be heard in Fairfax, VA in April of 2022.</p>

StarterPetitionUpdate,28892582,2021-04-16T19:57:16.000Z,,dc-entertainment-remove-amber-heard-from-aquaman-2,Bodycam Footage Drops,"<p>In a shocking turn of events, bodycam footage has dropped from the night Aber Heard claims that Johnny Depp hurled a phone at her face and trashed the condo.</p>
<p>On the night of the blowout fight, a friend of Heard, who asked to remain anonymous had dialed 911, claiming that the actress was being ‘assaulted’ by her boyfriend.</p>
<p>“Hi, I need to report an assault right now happening at 849 Broadway at the Eastern building, it’s penthouse three,” the female caller says in the recording, referring to the luxurious home the former couple previously shared in downtown LA.</p>
<p>“I happen to know that it’s happening and I just need to remain anonymous,” she added.</p>
<p>“So what did she say that this guy assaulted her or hit her?” the LAPD operator replies, explaining she needs more detail.</p>
<p>“Physically assaulting her, yeah,” replies the caller ”Send somebody up there please,” the caller pleads, reiterating the location of the couple’s penthouse before the call abruptly ends.</p>
<p>Another 911 call was made by Heard’s friend iO Tillet Wright.</p>
<p>That means that two sets of officers responded to the scene. And both sets of officers have insisted from day one that they saw no evidence of violence, not on Heard’s face, and not in the condo.</p>
<p>Up until now, it’s been a matter of he say/she say, leaving judges, journalists, and the public to decide who to believe.</p>
<p>But now, the debate is over. In bodycam footage from the second set of officers, the condo is clearly seen as being tidy and undamaged. You can read the article from the Daily Mail <a href=""https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-9474979/Johnny-Depp-says-police-bodycam-footage-PROVES-Amber-Heard-lying.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">HERE</a>.</p>
<p>And you can see a clear version of the bodycam footage <a href=""https://twitter.com/DigitalDDaniels/status/1383126221458915332"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">HERE</a>.</p>
<p>Depp’s attorney Adam Wadman says the footage proves that there was never any wrecking spree and that Heard’s account of the evening cannot be believed.</p>
<p>“Amber Heard and her friends described a chaotic, messy crime scene but the newly released LAPD bodycam videos unambiguously show that the penthouse was utterly undamaged and that their testimony was one more grandiose lie,” Waldman told DailyMail.com in a statement.</p>
<p>Depp and Heard will square off in April, 2022 in a defamation suit that Depp filed against his ex-wife. It remains to be seen how this new footage will affect the proceedings, but it doesn’t look good for Heard.</p>
<p>It also remains to be seen if this new evidence will inspire perjury charges in previously offered court testimony in Depp’s recent libel suit against NGN and the Sun tabloid in the UK. That’s where Heard described the chaotic scene.</p>
<p>Heard is currently being investigated for perjury charges in Australia for testimony surrounding an incident in which Heard smuggled the couple’s dogs into Australia in violation of quarantine laws.</p>
<p>It’s possible that these mounting legal woes will affect Heard’s appearance in any upcoming projects, and could potentially land her jail time. Time will tell the extent to which this new evidence, and Depp’s impending slander suit will affect Amber Heard.</p>
<p>What do you think? Will Heard shrug this evidence off? Or is this the mic drop moment for Depp in his quest to vindicate himself?</p>

StarterPetitionUpdate,28836434,2021-04-07T15:16:28.000Z,,dc-entertainment-remove-amber-heard-from-aquaman-2,Aquaman 2 filming and release dates,"<p>Aquaman 2 is expected to start production this coming June (2021) in the UK under the working title ‘Necrus.’ In Aquaman lore, Necrus is another underwater city like Atlantis, ruled by the militaristic King Mongo. Unlike Atlantis, its placement is unstable, meaning the location of the city constantly changes, never to be found in the same place twice. Apparently. So, while the working title could just be a fun nod to lore, it could also mean Arthur may interact, or even fight, Mongo. It’s safe to say that Black Manta will return as Aquaman’s nemesis.</p>
<p>Jason Momoa will return as the titular character, and despite fans’ protestations, Amber Heard is still clutching the notion that she will once again be the queen of the deep. However, there’s also been constant speculation that a new major female character is being written into the script, as a means to both increase diversity among the ensemble and reduce Heard’s screen time in the event of a worst case scenario. WB has yet to confirm that, but insider Daniel Richtman is now claiming that Aquaman 2 will have four female leads, though the tipster doesn’t offer any further details to elaborate on his intel.</p>
<p>Heard’s Mera, the aforementioned mystery character and Nicole Kidman’s returning Queen Atlanna will presumably make up 75% of the quartet, leaving one position unfilled. But with filming set to start a mere two months away, we should start to get some answers soon, both about the new mystery character and Heard’s dubious chances of returning as the film’s primary female lead.</p>
<p>Aquaman 2 is currently set for a December 16, 2022 release.</p>

It’s an interesting reaction, considering she already won the UK lawsuit, but apparently Amber Heard has simply had enough of the Internet backlash.</p>
<p>Adam Waldman called Amber out in a tweet pointing out that despite claims of being brutalized by Johnny Depp, Amber Heard appears days later in a photo shoot, without any sign of injury. </p>
<p>Heard's backlash was to call Waldman short. Such witty repartee. </p>
<p>It’s worth mentioning that Adam Waldman is actually Johnny Depp’s lawyer, and that he’s been using social media as a way to call Amber Heard and her claims into question. This includes much of the majority of his Twitter feed, but it was the particular image posted above that caught Amber Heard’s attention. It seemed she had enough of Adam Waldman, and decided to respond to him and a variety of Johnny Depp fans on Twitter as a result.</p>
<p>Most recently, Depp supporters have been targeted, having their comments reported en masse in an attempt to have them banned from Twitter. The Depp supporters remain, however, and don't appear to be going anywhere anytime soon. </p>

<p>Depp and Heard have to wait a full year before Depp's Defamation case against Heard gets to court. In that time, I'm sure we'll see a lot of action back and forth between Heard and her ex-husband. And, from the look of it, we can expect to see even more hostilities between Heard, her posse on Twitter, and Johnny Depp supporters.</p>

<p>Rubbish. I'd like to use a stronger word, but refrain.</p>
<p>As much as this is a blow to Johnny Depp, it's more of a defeat for male victims of domestic violence, particularly in the UK. This kind of finding tells them that, no. they won't be believed, so just shut up and take it, and don't you dare speak up. It shouldn't be that way. I must change.</p>
<p>The thing to remember at this point is that this verdict is not a win for Amber Heard. This case wasn't against her. It was against NGN and the Sun.</p>
<p>What we can do now is look forward to the Defamation trial in VA. That one is directly between Johnny Depp and Amber Heard. I'm a little nervous about that one because Heard never named Depp in her WaPo OpEd, the reason he finally sued her. On that basis alone, it could very well go her way, even though it's obvious who she was talking about. </p>
<p>But no matter how it goes, the truth about Heard will come out. There's evidence we haven't even seen yet. No matter how court goes, she loses in the court of public opinion, which will directly impact upon her career. Let's remember that she doesn't have any active projects coming up while Johnny Depp and his production company is directly involved with no fewer than 20 projects coming up. </p>
<p>This decision today is beyond ridiculous but it's one battle, not the war. Let's try to stay positive and look forward to the Virginia trial. It's a different court, a different case, and is more than likely to come out a different way. </p>

StarterPetitionUpdate,28633362,2021-03-01T18:23:47.000Z,,dc-entertainment-remove-amber-heard-from-aquaman-2,Amber Heard facing jail time?,"<p>According to <a href=""https://www.distractify.com/p/is-amber-heard-going-to-jail"" rel=""nofollow"">Distractify</a>, Amber Heard could be facing up to three years of jail time if the court rules in Johnny Depp’s favor.</p>
<p>Amber Heard could be going to jail if Johnny Depp wins his lawsuit.<br>Basically, Amber Heard claimed on the stand in Johnny’s libel suit against the Sun tabloid that Johnny Depp had physically and emotionally abused her.</p>
<p>Back in 2015, Heard showed up in court with a black eye seeking a restraining order. Johnny claims that Amber had faked her black eye seen at the court, and Amber Heard’s stylist corroborated this. She stated, “Throughout the day of December 16, 2015, I could see clearly that Amber Heard did not have any visible marks, bruises, cuts, or injuries to her face or any other part of her body.”</p>
<p>Since then, Johnny Depp has fought back against every bad word against him with libel and defamation lawsuits, so far against The Sun (which he lost), and against Amber Heard, which has not yet been seen in court. According to Deadline, the latest update is that their court date is once again pushed back to at least April 11, 2022. If Amber Heard loses, she could face jail time for tampering with evidence.</p>
<p>Even though it’s possible Johnny Depp could win his upcoming lawsuit in the coming years, there’s no confirming whether or not Amber Heard will face jail time. Regardless, this puts Warner Bros. in a tough spot. Even though fans had petitioned for Warner Bros. to force Amber Heard’s resignation from Aquaman 2, WB hasn’t announced any plans for change.</p>
<p>However, in December 2020, a lifestyle article in Forbes about Emilia Clarke’s home let the cat out of the bag that Emilia Clarke had signed on to replace Amber Heard as Mera in Aquaman 2. Sadly, though, there’s still no confirmation. It could just be wishful thinking on the fans’ part.</p>
<p>It’s not clear according to that article why Amber Heard could be facing jail time if Johnny Depp wins his appeal. They mention tampering with evidence, but don’t say clearly what evidence, or how it was tampered with.</p>
<p>I’m going to go out on a limb and suggest that if Johnny wins his appeal, Heard might be on the hook for some very serious perjury charges. She’s already being investigated in Australia for Perjury charges for falsifying statements about smuggling their dogs Pistol and Boo into the country. So it wouldn’t be a far stretch if she’s investigated in a London court for the same crime. Not for lying about the dogs, this time, though, but for potentially lying on the stand during Johnny’s libel case against NGN and the Sun tabloid.</p>
<p>It could be for something else altogether.</p>
<p>Let’s not forget that there’s no statute of limitations in Australia for grievous bodily injury requiring medical attention. And that’s where Heard cut off the tip of Johnny’s finger with a Vodka bottle. And, no. I’m not making a wild accusation there. Heard herself was recorded on audiotape admitting that she did, saying “I didn’t mean to do it!” and begging Johnny not to leave her.</p>
<p>The point being, if Johnny wanted to, he could always file a report with Australian police and have her put behind bars for a long time. And if her were the vengeful monster she keeps trying to say he is, he would have done that already.</p>
<p>All Johnny’s interested in is clearing his name. He’s said it time and time again, and the fact that Heard’s not cooling her heels already in an Australian prison proves it.</p>
<p>What do you think? Will Heard face jail time if Johnny wins his appeal? Or if he wins his defamation suit? Should Johnny press charges in Australia over his severed finger?</p>
<p>Yeah. I do too.</p>","{'id': '225270885', 'petitionMedium': {'url': '//assets.change.org/photos/1/yp/om/ahyPoMgOnXIvGwP-800x450-noPad.jpg?1614623031', 'processing': False}}",,,,against
StarterPetitionUpdate,28619185,2021-02-26T19:57:00.000Z,,dc-entertainment-remove-amber-heard-from-aquaman-2,Amber Heard Physically unfit?,"<p>It’s looking more and more like Amber Heard really won’t be in Aquaman 2.</p>
<p>This petition has reported long since that Heard’s contract has been bought out by WB and that she won’t appear in Aquaman 2. But the masses want proof, rightfully so. Well, the more time goes by, the more it looks like we might actually have been properly informed.</p>
<p>It’s being reported lately that Emilia Clarke might have signed on to replace Amber Heard in Aquaman 2. But, again, there’s no confirmation, though an article in Forbes seems to be as legit a source as it gets. So we can’t be sure about that part of the speculation about Amber Heard’s dubious future in AM2.</p>
<p>However…</p>
<p>Recently, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nf2AgE2eE8M"" rel=""nofollow"">Popcorned Planet</a>’s Andy Signore went on record saying: “The part of this story that is true is that, yes, Amber Heard is fired from Aquaman 2. Now, from what I’ve heard so far she’s been fired from Aquaman 2. From what I’ve heard through a source, though other people that are involved in the production is that it already happened.”</p>
<p>Previously, we’ve heard that WB bought out Heard’s contract because she might not be bondable (due to alcohol and drug use, perhaps?). If she can’t be insured for the duration of filming, she can’t film.</p>
<p>But the reason might be something completely different than what we thought.</p>
<p>According to <a href=""https://www.sausageroll.com.au/entertainment/movies/amber-heard-aquaman-2-contract-terminated-for-health-fitness-reasons/"" rel=""nofollow"">Sausage Roll</a>, Amber Heard might not appear in AM2 because she ‘s not physically fit enough. They say: “Amber Heard did not pass her physical examination. She’s put on some pounds and is in terrible shape. There is a clause in her contract which says she is required to be in good form ahead of shooting and she violated that.”</p>
<p>True to form, Heard manages to blame Johnny Depp for it, throwing Covid in for good measure. “Heard allegedly blamed Johnny Depp and COVID-19 for her deteriorating health, saying that she’s been under tremendous amount of stress and has been suffering from depression but she insists that she will get back in shape.”</p>
<p>Filming for Aquaman 2 is set to start filming in June (2021), so it remains to be seen whether or not she’ll get back in shape. We’ll also have to wait and see if she is, or becomes, bondable for filming.</p>
<p>That seems like a lot to happen in just a few months.</p>
<p>Also, according to another industry insider, Heard may have failed to report an injury. If she were injured, failed to report it and got further injured during training, which is quite rigorous, the studio would have been on the hook for it. So, it's entirely possible that this is the nature of Heard being physically unfit.</p>
<p>Whichever the reason it seems more likely than not that the rumors about Amber Heard not appearing in AM2 are true. I don’t know whether it will Emelia Clarke or not that takes over, but I’m totally on board with it if it is.</p>
<p>What do you think? Will Amber Heard fit back into the fish suit again or will we see somebody else taking over screen time in AM2?</p>

StarterPetitionUpdate,28613653,2021-02-25T21:01:42.000Z,,dc-entertainment-remove-amber-heard-from-aquaman-2,Johnny Depp pissed off?,"<p>The latest story coming from leaker Daniel Richtman is saying that <a href=""https://wegotthiscovered.com/movies/johnny-depp-reportedly-furious-amber-heard-job-offers/"" rel=""nofollow"">Johnny Depp is furious</a> that his ex-wife Amber Heard’s star appears to be rising as his falls. According to Richtman Depp is “pissed” that she keeps getting work.</p>
<p>Heard recently appeared in CBS’ The Stand and is about to film Aquaman 2 despite multiple <a href=""https://wegotthiscovered.com/movies/petition-amber-heard-fired-aquaman-2-closing-2m-signatures/"" rel=""nofollow"">fan campaigns</a> trying to get her fired (Mera will also play a minor role in Zack Snyder’s Justice League next month, a movie that’s already been filmed).</p>
<p>But it’s the latest rumor doing the rounds that must seriously enrage Depp, as reports say that Heard is in contention to portray <a href=""https://wegotthiscovered.com/movies/amber-heard-reportedly-play-liveaction-rapunzel-disney/"" rel=""nofollow"">Rapunzel</a> in Disney’s live-action version of Tangled.</p>
<p>The actress potentially being hired by the House of Mouse for a big role just as they drop Depp from his most iconic part (Captain Jack Sparrow, of Disney’s Pirates of the Caribbean franchise) must really stick in his craw.</p>
<p>But this story isn’t over yet, as Depp is mounting an appeal to the verdict in his failed libel suit against NGN media and the Sun tabloid, and there are lawsuits filed in Virginia that could go more favorably for him.</p>
<p>Still, According to Richtman, right now, Heard is going from strength-to-strength and Johnny Depp is suffering major career damage. So even if he’s eventually vindicated, he might never again be the A-lister he once was.</p>
<p>Where to start.</p>
<p>First, the sober truth is that Heard is a little long in the tooth to portray a Disney princess. Those girls are usually in their mid-teens, and Heard is twice that age now. It’s highly unlikely that she’s up for any such part.</p>
<p>Second, after Heard has pestered Disney with subpoenas and legal shenanigans, it’s not likely at all that they would line up to sign her for anything, let alone a role half her age.</p>
<p>Third, Johnny is not hurting for work. If you look at Depp’s <a href=""https://pro.imdb.com/name/nm0000136?rf=cons_nm_meter&amp;ref_=cons_nm_meter"" rel=""nofollow"">IMDB pro</a> page, he’s lined up to be involved with more than twenty projects.</p>
<p>Heard has <a href=""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1720028/"" rel=""nofollow"">2 projects</a> on her books. Aquaman 2, which she probably won’t appear in. Strong rumor has it that Emilia Clark will replace Heard in Aquaman 2.</p>
<p>The other project is “Run away with me” a project which was abandoned years ago. Two movies she will most likely not even appear in. That’s it. That’s all she’s got scheduled for future projects.</p>
<p>Finally, but not least, it’s looking more and more like Johnny Depp is going to be vindicated in both court proceedings, leaving him in a much more favorable position than Heard.</p>
<p>So it’s not quite as bleak for Depp as Richtman would have you believe. Either his information is faulty or he’s just plain wrong.</p>
<p>What do you think? Is Heard’s star rising? Or is Depp coming out on top?</p>","{'id': '225257223', 'petitionMedium': {'url': '//assets.change.org/photos/8/pj/sq/bdpJsQhkPxDtqNI-800x450-noPad.jpg?1614286904', 'processing': False}}",,,,against
StarterPetitionUpdate,28602060,2021-02-24T00:26:36.000Z,,dc-entertainment-remove-amber-heard-from-aquaman-2,Trial date pushed back,"<p>The defamation suit Johnny Depp took out against his ex wife Amber Heard was scheduled to on May 7th, 2021. But, probably due to Covid, the trial date has been pushed back to April 11th, 2022.</p>
<p>Now, it's possible that Johnny will get word back about his appeal to overturn the verdict in his libel suit against NGN and The Sun tabloid before he even sets foot in the courtroom for his defamation suit against Heard. He might be vindicated on the British front first.</p>
<p>Heard has been worried in the past about how the defamation suit will affect her filming schedule. But if she's found to have lied in a British court, and if Australia has their way about her lying in one of their courts, her filming schedule might be the last thing she'll have to worry about. </p>
<p>Instead, the courts might have to figure out how to het her from jail to the courtroom. That could make for some interesting travel plans.</p>
<p>Somehow, I doubt that the flight they'd put her on would have Champaign and caviar.  </p>
<p>What do you think? Will Heard go to jail for lying to a British High Court? Or will she get out of it somehow?</p>

<p><a href=""https://insidethemagic.net/2021/02/amber-heard-tangled-ad1/"" rel=""nofollow"">One article</a> says that she's negotiating to play princess Rapunzel in Tangled. <a href=""https://www.giantfreakinrobot.com/ent/amber-heard-disney-princess.html"" rel=""nofollow"">Another one</a> backs it up.</p>
<p>I'm not quite sure how seriously to take these revelations. </p>
<p>First, there's the messy legal battle that's warring between Amber Heard and her ex-husband Johnny Depp. It's a sordid affair, and Heard has dragged Disney into it by demanding a plethora of documents from them, pretty much any dealing they ever had with Johnny Depp, his schedule, his contracts, his alleged drug use or bad behavior on the set, anything she can get her hands on.</p>
<p>Maybe it's just me, but I don't think that Disney would be too quick to negotiate with somebody who's causing them so many legal woes.</p>
<p>And second, there's the demographic of Disney princesses. Traditionally, Disney princesses are in their mid-teens, just coming into their own. Amber Heard is 34 years old, and not getting any younger. That's just about twice the age of the average Disney princess. </p>
<p>I suppose it's not impossible that Heard could be in talks with Disney to portray a princess, but I think it's highly unlikely.</p>
<p>A lot of frivolous press has been floating around about Heard lately, but I personally think that this is among the more amusing. </p>
<p>What do you think? Would Amber Heard personify a Disney princess? Or has the time for kind of role come and long gone for her?</p>","{'id': '225220517', 'petitionMedium': {'url': '//assets.change.org/photos/8/lw/xn/KIlwxNJYTqhbTMN-800x450-noPad.jpg?1613504731', 'processing': False}}",,,,against
StarterPetitionUpdate,28555166,2021-02-15T20:49:24.000Z,,dc-entertainment-remove-amber-heard-from-aquaman-2,Amber Heard wants Aquaman 3,"<p>Often when putting together a franchise, the powers that be offer the principal players a three picture deal. That cuts down on scheduling conflicts and keeps actors from negotiating for a better deal in-between each picture. But that’s not always the case. Just as often, they take it one film at a time.</p>
<p>In the case of the Aquaman franchise, it looks like they opted to do one film at a time. If that is indeed the case, no actor is guaranteed a part in the second or third installment.</p>
<p>According to insider Daniel Richtman, Amber Heard is already scrambling to try to secure her place in Aquaman 3, even though AM2 hasn’t even begun to film yet.</p>
<p>There are doubts about whether or not Heard will even appear in AM2. Almost 2 million people have made it clear that they don’t want to see Amber Heard in any further AM films, and it’s possible that WB is paying attention. One rumor has it that Heard’s screen time in AM2 is being severely curtailed, with another female lead taking on more screen time.</p>
<p>Other rumors whisper that Heard’s contract has been bought out, meaning that while Heard got paid, she will not appear in the film at all.</p>
<p>There are several factors that will likely determine whether Heard comes back in any subsequent Aquaman films. First, there are the court cases going back and forth between Heard and her ex-husband, Johnny Depp. Depp is suing Heard for Defamation for portraying him as a domestic abuser who physically abused and terrorized her throughout their marriage. Depp is having none of that is on a legal crusade to clear his good name and prove that it was Heard who was the abuser the entire time. Heard has a lot of sob storied and the support of her friends to back up her abuse storied, while Depp has video and audio recordings of her admitting to abusing him. Unlike Heard, Depp also has medical evidence, including a fingertip that got severed and a burn on his cheek from a cigarette being put out on his face.</p>
<p>The two are also embroiled in litigation in England from a libel case that Depp leveled against NGN media and the Sun tabloid, for calling Depp a wife-beater. Initially, the judgement favored the Sun, who repeated that wife-beater claim again. But Depp is appealing the verdict, and will likely prevail.</p>
<p>If these two cases go Depp’s way, it doesn’t bode well for Heard’s continued presence in the AM franchise. Most films have a morals clause in their contracts, and if Heard is proven to be a domestic abuser again, that clause might very well be invoked.</p>
<p>I say “again” because Heard was arrested in 2009 for domestic abuse against her then wife Tasya Van Ree.</p>
<p>There’s also the issue of whether or not Heard is bondable. That is to say, whether or not she can be insured for the duration of filming. If she can’t be insured for any reason, like a preexisting medical condition, excessive drug or alcohol abuse, she can’t and won’t be hired for any future AM project.</p>
<p>Heard supporters insist that she’ll be in AM2 and 3 because there hasn’t been any official announcement from WB about her being dropped. But that’s not the way it works. If Heard has been dropped, there likely won’t be any announcement. The movie will simply come out without her in it. So fans who want her dropped who are waiting for an announcement won’t get one. We’ll just have to wait for the film to come out to see whether she’s in it or not.</p>
<p>Time will have to tell whether or not Amber Heard is in Aquaman 2, let alone Aquaman 3. We’ll have to wait and see how those court cases come out, and whether or not Heard is bondable. As ever, I’ll bring you the latest as I find it.</p>

StarterPetitionUpdate,28550493,2021-02-14T20:58:00.000Z,,dc-entertainment-remove-amber-heard-from-aquaman-2,Amber Heard is a nobody,"<p>Amber Heard is a nobody, at least according to Amber Heard. In one of her latest court filings, Amber has a fit about people calling her that.</p>
<p>If you recall, Heard filed in her original $100 million dollar counterclaim to Johnny Depp’s $50 million dollar defamation suit against her, that there was an army of bots under Depp’s command torturing her. Even creating and/or signing this very petition. An investigation found less than a dozen questionable Twitter accounts that might be bots, blowing that claim out of the water.</p>
<p>Undaunted, Heard has shoved forward, trying to obtain personal data about 200 Twitter users, to prove that they’re bots and not real people, I guess.</p>
<p>Now, she’s down to two. TWO people that she’s upset at for: 1) saying they’re proud of Johnny Depp for fighting to clear his name, and 2) refer to the defendant (Heard), a movie star, as “a nobody.” And she had to put that in there, that she’s “a movie star.” She needed to point that out, I suppose, in case anybody forgets that she got lucky off the back of being married to Johnny Depp and scored Aquaman. Would she have gotten that movie on her own? Anybody? Bueller?</p>
<p>She’s throwing everything she can at the wall with regards to Twitter users, hoping that something will stick.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, all of the statements she’s throwing around by Twitter fans are protected opinions of celebrities. People just don’t like her, and there’s not one single thing she can do about it.</p>
<p>What I suspect, however, is that she doesn’t really expect any of this Twitter bluster to stick to the wall. I think it’s a diversionary tactic, intended to direct attention away from the avalanche of evidence Johnny Depp has that’s bearing down on her.</p>
<p>And it works. For a minute. But she’s deluding only herself if she thinks that the people who support Johnny Depp are about to lose sight of the big picture. They might point fingers and laugh at her folly when she tries some new antic, but they’re steadfast to the case at the heart of the matter.</p>
<p>What will she pull next? What new filing will she throw at the court to try to filibuster her way out of the inevitable? We’ll have to wait and see. One thing that’s sure is that it’ll bring out more finger pointing and giggles, at least until the final verdicts come down. Then it will be Johnny Depp that gets the last laugh.</p>

StarterPetitionUpdate,28532880,2021-02-11T14:36:03.000Z,,dc-entertainment-remove-amber-heard-from-aquaman-2,iO tries to quash subpoena,"<p>iO Tillet-Wright, fast friend of Amber Heard, is the guy that called 911 the fateful night of Amber Heard and Johnny Depp’s last fight. You know, the one where Heard claimed that Depp struck her in the face with a phone.</p>
<p>iO has been very vocal in his support of Heard, claiming to bear witness to the after-effects of many violent episodes where Heard said that Depp brutalized her. Blood on a pillow, hair on the floor, that sort of thing. Mind you, iO never witnessed any violence, just saw that (staged?) scene afterwards.</p>
<p>Now, iO is trying to quash the subpoena calling for him to appear for a deposition.</p>
<p>In his motion to quash, iO says: “I am not a party to the above-referenced actions. I have personal knowledge of the matters set forth herein, and if called upon to testify thereto, I could and would completely do so.”</p>
<p>But…</p>
<p>“I have never been served with any subpoena in this action (Case No. 19stcp04763) or in the Virginia Fairfax County Court Action (Case no. CL-2019-0002911). Rather, I understand that Mr. Depp’s lawyers emailed copies of the subpoena to my lawyer, Lee Brenner, on January 20, 2021.”</p>
<p>“I do not reside at the address of 6144 Panorama Street, Joshua Tree, CA 92252, and I have never resided at that address. I have no ownership interest in that address.”</p>
<p>I understand that a man named Anthony was at the address that day, and I have spoken to him. He said that he spoke to a process server that day (Jan 19, 2021) who left a pile of papers on the front step.”</p>
<p>“I declare under penalty of perjury and under the laws of the State of California that the foregoing is true and correct.”</p>
<p>“Executed this 8th day of February 2021, and Joshua Tree, California.”</p>
<p>And he signed it.</p>
<p>Further: “Here, Mr. Wright was not served with the subpoena at issue. See Wright Cecl. At ¶ 3-5. First, he does not reside at the address listed on the Subpoena nor does he have any ownership interest in that address. Id., at ¶3, Mr. Wright has spoken with a man named Anthony who was at the address listed on the “proof of service” on January 19 2021 and was told that a process server left a pile of papers on the front step. Id., at ¶5. Mr. Wright does not know why anyone would say that they served him because they simply did not. Id., at ¶ 4. In the light of the foregoing, the subpoenas are procedurally defective and should be quashed.</p>
<p>Okay, then.</p>
<p>First, if iO has no ownership or interest in that address, how does he know who was there on that day or any other? He clearly knows more than he's letting on, to have spoken with a man he says was there that day.</p>
<p>Look, I don’t care one way or another where iO lives, but this just doesn’t add up.</p>
<p>What’s iO so scared of that he’s trying to dodge his subpoena? Is he afraid that the hoax is finally going to catch up with him and that he could face charges of perjury if he lies to an American court? Fines can be hefty, and jail isn’t exactly kind to trans persons.</p>
<p>Maybe the time has come for iO to reconsider his position in the Amber Heard fiasco. Because, dodge as he might, that subpoena is going to catch up to him, like it or not.</p>

StarterPetitionUpdate,28508017,2021-02-07T17:17:38.000Z,,dc-entertainment-remove-amber-heard-from-aquaman-2,Russian Bots sign the Petition,"<p>In an interesting turn of events, a <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbz-aaNo56U"" rel=""nofollow"">new video</a> has surfaced of somebody using Russian bots to sign the petition to remove Amber Heard from Aquaman 2.</p>
<p>In <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbz-aaNo56U"" rel=""nofollow"">the video</a>, a nameless, faceless person uses a Russian website to create over 2,000 signatures.</p>
<p>According to the video’s creator, for over 16 hours his bot signed the petition over 2,000 times. It can do 3,000 a day from ONE bot channel and infinitely more from multiple channels.</p>
<p>The fact that the bots in this case are being made to look Russian in origin plays right into Amber Heard's narrative that all or most of the signatures on the petition are fake. And it's important that they're of Russian origin, since great measures were taken to try to tie them to Adam Waldman, Johnny Depp's lawyer and friend.</p>
<p>According to this article: ""The bot’s Russian origin is a crucial aspect of this story. Adam Waldman, Johnny Depp’s attorney who was barred from his upcoming libel case in the United States, is a former lobbyist for Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska, a Russian billionaire, and Kremlin insider. It’s believed by some he was involved with or has insider knowledge, of the 2016 hacking of the US election.""</p>
<p>Laying it on really thick in the anti-Waldman crusade.</p>
<p>In recent history, two things have apparently bothered Amber Heard: Adam Waldman and this petition. She took care of Waldman by successfully lobbying to get him removed from Johnny Depp's upcoming Fairfax defamation case against Amber Heard. That backfired, though, since removing Waldman from the case left him free to discuss the case freely. And he has been. Check out <a href=""https://twitter.com/adam_waldman"" rel=""nofollow"">Waldman's Twitter</a> feed to read some delightful insights into the case.</p>
<p>And it's obvious that the petition bothers Heard, who mentions it prominently in her $100 million dollar countersuit.</p>
<p>It's not the first time action has been taken to try and get the petition removed. Not long ago, negative comments were posted on the petition, and then reported as violations to try to get the petition taken down.</p>
<p>That didn't work, and this isn't going to, either. I've already been in contact with Change.org, and rest assured. The petition is quite safe.</p>
<p>Johnny Depp has a hearing on 18 March regarding his appeal in the UK libel case against the Sun, and the defamation suit in Fairfax is due to start in May - if it's not pushed back due to Covid.</p>
<p>With these cases looming so large, it's possible that more shenanigans will pop up trying to further discredit Adam Waldman and attack the petition. Hopefully, both of these cases will reach fruition soon, and the matter can be decided, once and for all. </p>
<p>How do you think these cases will play out? Will Johnny Depp get justice? Or will Amber Heard prevail?</p>

For instance, Aquaman 2 could recast the entire ensemble from top to bottom and people would still be willing to check it out, as long as Jason Momoa remained on board as Arthur Curry.</p>
<p>Of course, there’ve been a lot of fans threatening to boycott the DCEU sequel entirely based on Amber Heard’s continued involvement in the underwater adventures, although she doesn’t care in the slightest and can’t wait to suit up as Mera again. However, there are reports making the rounds that a new female lead is being introduced as well, one that could potentially reduce Heard’s screen time in the finished product depending on how her next court case opposite ex-husband Johnny Depp plays out.</p>
<p>On that note, insider Daniel Richtman is now claiming that the actress is furious after catching wind of the decision, and isn’t happy with Warner Bros. trying to essentially force her out of the spotlight as the female lead of the highest-grossing DC Comics adaptation in history. </p>
<p>We might take this report with a grain of salt, though, considering insiders in the industry have been saying for months that Heard won't be in Aquaman 2 at all. </p>
<p>Sources say that WB has bought out Heard's contract completely. That means that she'll be compensated for her contract without actually appearing in the film. </p>

<p>Johnny Depp and his legal team immediately appealed the decision.</p>
<p>The appeals process has been rather involved, first going to the original judge to approve or deny that the appeal should move forward, which the judge denied. It was his judgement, after all. That was to be expected.</p>
<p>That left team Depp open to take the appeal to the next level, further requesting that the judge's denial should be overlooked and that the appeal should move forward.</p>
<p>That process could have left Depp and his crew in legal limbo for a year or more. But now, Depp's lawyers have asked for permission to introduce new evidence. That's ramped up the process, and there's going to be a hearing on the evidence, and the appeal at large.</p>
<p>The hearing is set for March 18th. </p>
<p>If granted, this matter could be decided much sooner than we thought.</p>

StarterPetitionUpdate,28491118,2021-02-04T20:05:59.000Z,,dc-entertainment-remove-amber-heard-from-aquaman-2,Amber Heard's late night Twitter rant,"<p>Following Evan Rachel Wood revealed Marilyn Manson as her alleged abuser, Amber Heard just can’t seem to keep her face out of it. She’s tying herself to Wood, including them together in her claims railing against men she seems to allege are getting away with abusing women, calling out the media, saying: “...and yet, no one sees the trend here? Everyone wants to tag a bathroom wall, no one wants to understand the writing. Evan &amp; I aren’t the 1st to raise our hands. Are you done ignoring it?”</p>
<p>It seems that Heard went on a bender last night, posting about how the media seems to be ignoring Marilyn Manson after Wood’s allegations.</p>
<p>What it’s got to do with her, one has to wonder. There are some Johnny Depp fans that really don’t want to see Johnny dragged through the mud in the Manson case, but it seems that Heard is desperate to make sure that he is, by association.</p>
<p>In her meltdown, at one point, Heard goes off on somebody that calls her a fraud, telling them to shut up if they haven’t been in a situation where they were being strangled and fighting for their life. And, true to fashion, she did it using the tweenspeak trend of using numbers to abbreviate words, making it that much harder to take her accusations and vitriol seriously.</p>
<p>Is she now saying that she herself has been strangled? Are these new allegations she’s coming up with against Johnny Depp, or did she at one point say that he was strangling her while he was brutalizing her. Is that part of the testimony she gave behind closed doors? Or was that “just” about being brutally raped? Is there anything she won’t come up with to throw at Johnny Depp to try and make her case stick?</p>
<p>In another post, she continues her rage against rich white men, which some might say is rather ironic since those have been the type of men she’s spent her intimate time with. Or, perhaps she’s just talking about the ones that have rejected her.</p>
<p>If you recall, Heard’s former assistant Kate James revealed that Heard stole her story of being raped. Is she now appropriating Wood’s story about being strangled?</p>

They're taken out of order, from different posts and different conversations, but they are her own words, so enjoy. </p>
<p>Heard amusingly refer to Johnny Depp fans as Wald-Mignons - referring to Depp's lawyer and friend Adam Waldman. I'm pretty sure she meant minions, but fell flat with the intended slight. One fan responded that Mignon actually means cute or pretty, ""...so, thanks.""</p>
<p>It seems that Heard is desperate at this point, especially with Depp’s appeal in the UK case looming so near in the future. We all thought we’d have to wait up to two years to hear anything else about that, but here it is, with a huge milestone in the case happening just next month.</p>
<p>Yes, she seems desperate. And with what could be a huge victory for Depp looming large on the very near horizon, it stands to reason that we'll likely see more from Heard, whether it's in the context of her own case or not. </p>

<p>Following a three-week trial in July last year, Mr. Justice Nicol ruled that Mr Depp, 57, assaulted Ms. Heard, 34, on a dozen occasions and put her in “fear for her life” at least three times.</p>
<p>Depp is challenging that ruling.</p>
<p>As of yesterday, Johnny Depp’s legal team is asking to submit new evidence that was previously unheard during the trial but has direct bearing upon Depp’s appeal request.</p>
<p>There’s some speculation among netizens as to what that evidence could be. Some hope for those salacious Toronto tapes, but more think that the new evidence has to do with proving that Heard lied about donating $7 million dollars to charity as a condition of their divorce. It was those charitable donations that caused Justice Nicol to decide that Heard was not a “gold digger.” If it can be proven that she didn’t donate the money, Nicol’s finding in that regard can definitely be challenged, and could affect whether or not Depp can continue with his appeal process.</p>
<p>There will be a two-hour hearing sometime between March 15th and 30th regarding that matter.</p>

StarterPetitionUpdate,28469977,2021-02-02T00:02:36.000Z,,dc-entertainment-remove-amber-heard-from-aquaman-2,Evan Rachel Wood accuses Marilyn Manson,"<p>Evan Rachel wood has been talking for a couple of years about having been allegedly horribly abused by an ex. She spoke before panels and worked hard to try to reform domestic abuse laws.</p>
<p>Today, she came forward with the name of her <a href=""https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/celebrities/2021/02/01/marilyn-manson-accused-horrifically-abusing-evan-rachel-wood/4335539001/#:~:text=Manson%2C%20in%20a%202009%20Q%26A,told%20the%20outlet%20of%20Wood."" rel=""nofollow"">alleged abuser: Marilyn Manson</a>. The two got together when Wood was in her teens and MM was in his thirties.</p>
<p>There are a lot of people who immediately believe Wood because of her history of talking about this alleged abuse, and because Manson is just so weird. Also because he wrote in his autobiography that he used to be an abusive piece of shit and that he used to imagine crushing her skull with a sledgehammer. And for saying that the song “I Want to Kill You Like They Do in The Movies” was inspired by one of their breakups.</p>
<p>On top of that, four other women have stepped forward with similar accusations of their own against MM.</p>
<p>All of that, along with Wood’s disturbing allegations have a lot of people willing to crucify MM on the nearest telephone pole.</p>
<p>What does that have to do with Amber Heard or Aquaman 2? At first glance, nothing. But if we take a closer look, the associations abound.</p>
<p>First, ERW is “close” friends with Heard. Wood has come out in <a href=""https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/english/hollywood/news/Evan-Rachel-Wood-defends-Amber-Heard-amid-her-feud-with-Johnny-Depp/articleshow/53280392.cms"" rel=""nofollow"">support of Heard</a>’s allegations against Johnny Depp since Heard first started to allege them – which is just about the time that Wood started talking about being a victim of domestic abuse. Coincidence number one.</p>
<p>Also, it’s a pretty well-known fact that MM is (or was) best of buddies with Johnny Depp. The two of them haven’t been seen together in about a year, but they have a long history of being besties. Whether or not that’s still the case isn’t really known.</p>
<p>It’s also a fact that as far as I know, none of the women accusing MM ever called the police or filed any reports. The only word we have is in the media and on social media. I’m not saying that makes them liars, far from it. A lot of victims never report their abuse. Johnny Depp didn’t call the police. He relied upon his own private security to protect him.</p>
<p>All I’m saying is that the allegations against MM are pretty severe, with women saying they’ve been violently raped, had their lives threatened, were locked in closets, were beaten, even whipped, and more. With allegations so severe, it’s easy to wonder why the police weren’t called, at least by one of them. It would certainly make the allegations easier to swallow.</p>
<p>I’m also not saying MM didn’t do it. His own words in his autobiography don’t bode well for him, certainly.</p>
<p>What I’m saying is that we need to wait and see some proof, one way or the other. Until that happens, all we have is a she-say/he-say situation.</p>
<p>It could come down in a number of ways. MM could be the heartless, sadistic monster his self-proclaimed victims say he is, and he should be locked up for life.</p>
<p>Or it could come down that the girls are in cahoots. Wood and Heard, I mean. The two of them, friends, have been alleging abuse against MM and Johnny Depp for roughly the same amount of time, and now would be a great time to come forward with MM’s name, what with the legalities between Heard and Johnny Depp shaping up the way they are. It’s not looking too good for Heard in the Fairfax, VA defamation case Johnny has leveled against her. So what better time to cut the legs out from under Johnny’s bff with allegations of even more monstrous abuse?</p>
<p>Or the two cases could have nothing whatsoever to do with each other but coincidence.</p>
<p>Right now, it’s too soon to call.</p>
<p>One thing that is a fact is that Amber Heard has made it more difficult for victims of either gender to come forward with their stories of abuse thanks to her lies about being abused. Her sh*tstorm of mainstream media stories and crusade through the #MeToo movement have made it nigh impossible for anybody to come forward without enduring intense scrutiny. Gone are the days when we could #BelieveAllWomen. Heard’s completely ruined that.</p>
<p>So yeah. While there is a faction ready to believe her outright, ERW is being looked at with some skepticism by a large contingency.</p>
<p>The only real truth here is that time will have to tell the truth of what’s going on. My suggestion is to neither believe nor deny these allegations against MM until there’s some shred of proof to back them up, or to prove that they’re false.</p>
<p>That’s what happened with Johnny Depp. He was accused of domestic abuse and a lot of people believed it. Then proof came out that those allegations were false.</p>
<p>That’s what I’m saying we should do here. Wait for some proof. Reserve judgement until we know definitively, one way or the other. The truth always outs, and it will in this case, too.</p>
<p>What do you think? Hang the dude’s reputation on her word? Or wait and see?</p>","{'id': '225158142', 'petitionMedium': {'url': '//assets.change.org/photos/9/rl/ds/fMrlDSKhJQkHUzj-800x450-noPad.jpg?1612224157', 'processing': False}}",,,,against

<p>Let's take a look at that, shall we?</p>
<p>Jason Momoa's total net worth is reported to be $14 million, and that's combined with his wife, former Cosby kid Lisa Bonet's net worth. It's not impossible that Momoa was paid a figure in the millions, but it's not likely. </p>
<p>Let's take a look at some examples for comparison.</p>
<p>Robert Downey Jr, a talented and well-respected actor was reportedly paid $500 thousand for Iron Man. </p>
<p>Gal Gadot was reportedly paid $300 thousand for Wonder Woman.</p>
<p>These two were the stars of their movies. And we're supposed to believe that Amber Heard was paid $7 million for a supporting role? It's not impossible, I suppose. But I suspect that pigs would sooner fly.</p>
<p>The same magazine clip claims that Heard will probably make closer to $10 million for her part in Aquaman 2.</p>
<p>Let's take a look at that, too.</p>
<p>Sources have confirmed that Amber Heard will not be in Aquaman 2. She hasn't been fired, exactly. Word has it that she was never re-hired. Being bondable is one concern. Morals clause infringements might very well be another.</p>
<p>Rather, her contract has reportedly been bought out by WB. So, while she might have been paid for the project, she will likely not appear in it.</p>
<p>Like other stories about Amber Heard, I suspect that this one is greatly exaggerated. </p>
<p>What do you think? Is Heard dipped in gold and worth millions? Or is she on her way out the door from Hollywood?</p>","{'id': '225152561', 'petitionMedium': {'url': '//assets.change.org/photos/3/bq/tt/uLbQtToFGCFlEYl-800x450-noPad.jpg?1612123406', 'processing': False}}",,,,against
StarterPetitionUpdate,28451726,2021-01-29T20:31:22.000Z,,dc-entertainment-remove-amber-heard-from-aquaman-2,Fairfax and Oz,"<p>It's entirely possible that Johnny Depp's defamation trial against his ex-wife Amber Heard might get pushed back into the timing of when Heard claims she's supposed to be filming Aquaman 2. </p>
<p>Remember when Johnny Depp wanted to make arrangements for the trial to allow for his filming of FB? Heard successfully argued against it, refusing to let the court make any such allowances for him. That might, in part, have been why Johnny Depp was asked to step down from the franchise. His filming schedule would have been interrupted - partly by that three-day deposition she made him sit for that conflicted with filming.</p>
<p>Well, now the shoe is on the other foot.</p>
<p>Because of court's Covid-related scheduling conflicts, the case may very well be pushed back into what she claims will be HER filming schedule. And, since she already argued against scheduling court around filming for him, the same applies to her. </p>
<p>If .court couldn't be rescheduled for him, it can't be rescheduled for her.</p>
<p>Sauce for the gander is just as good for the goose.</p>
<p>There's also the small matter of fact that filming for Aquaman 2 will take place in Australia, where Heard is being investigated for perjury in relation to smuggling her dogs into Australia. </p>
<p>Given both of these circumstances, and the fact that reliable sources report that her contract has been bought out, chances are very slim (see what I did there?) that Heard will appear in Aquaman 2.</p>
<p>What do you think? Will Heard be AM2? Or is she all washed up?</p>

<p>No. There's no evidence to show that this clump of hair ""broke"" off during a violent tussle. And that begs the question: Where did it come from? Is it possible that this photo is staged to try to frame Depp?</p>

<p>Let's take a look at that, shall we? </p>
<p>Amber Heard recorded conversations with herself and ex Johnny Depp, in which she calls him a baby for ducking out of fights. She criticizes him harshly for leaving every single fight, admonishing him for not staying and fighting.</p>
<p>She also admits to being the one that starts physical fights. Johnny answers that when things get physical, they have to separate, and she berates him again, daring him to tell the world that he's a victim because nobody will believe him.</p>

<p>Now, you tell me. Does it sound like the action of a violent man to leave whenever fights get physical, started by Heard, by her own admission?</p>
<p>Of course not. But there are people out there that want to believe Heard because she's a woman, or who haven't bothered to educate themselves to the facts of the case.</p>
<p>That's why Johnny's case is so important. Not just to clear his own name, but to clear a path for abused men to be able to come forward as victims and be believed.</p>

<p>There's a subpoena issued for ""an executive"" from Disney, seeking: “all information relating to documents and communications of any nature” on Depp and “incidents of drug or alcohol use (including suspected drug or alcohol use).” Similarly, they are looking for any information about “any delays or tardiness caused by Mr. Depp,” “any incidents of violence or abuse by Mr. Depp,” any info on impute the actor had or “hiring, casting,” and “disagreements with the writers, directors or producers with the filming, editing and/or release of Pirates 5.”</p>
<p>There's a subpoena out for the LAPD as well, wanting: everything that the police have on file regarding a May altercation between Heard and Depp that led to Heard receiving a restraining order against Depp. And they mean everything. Any correspondence, body cam footage, everything. </p>
<p>Heard insists that the final altercation between herself and Johnny Depp was Depp's fault because he was physically and verbally abusing her. Johnny insists that the altercation never happened, that it's a hoax perpetrated by Heard and her close circle of friends.</p>
<p>If body cam footage of the police's response exists, it could go a long way toward proving one position or the other. </p>
<p>The court date is looming ever nearer. We'll have to wait and see how this one goes. If you remember Johnny lost a libel suit against the Sun because the judge said he believed Heard. </p>
<p>That case is under appeal, so we'll have to see how that one turns out, too. It's not over for Johnny in either case. Not by a long shot. He is determined to clear his name, and there is an army of fans worldwide that support him wholeheartedly. </p>
<p>I'm one of them.</p>

StarterPetitionUpdate,28328823,2021-01-08T16:13:57.000Z,,dc-entertainment-remove-amber-heard-from-aquaman-2,Heard's missing Donations,"<p>As part of her divorce settlement, Amber Heard pledged to donate her entire 7 million dollar settlement to charity. Namely, to the American Civil Liberties Union and the Children’s Hospital of Los Angeles.</p>
<p>Heard has said in numerous interviews in the last several years that the money was donated, split between those two charities. She also testified to it under oath, under penalty of Perjury.</p>
<p>Well, lately, things have gotten really interesting. Turns out the only contribution that’s been made to the Children’s hospital was the original $100,000 Johnny Depp made on her behalf. And there’s no proof of what, if anything, Amber Heard donated to the ACLU herself. Apparently there have been donations made on her behalf, but no proof that she, herself, donated a single red cent.</p>
<p>For one thing, it was part of a legally binding contract (her divorce), that she would donate that money. For another thing, she testified under penalty of perjury that she donated it.</p>
<p>As I understand it, the penalty for Perjury in the UK is up to 7 years in prison. Pile that on top of perjury charges she’s being investigated for in Australia, and those years are really starting to pile up on her.</p>
<p>In a truly amusing turn of events, Amber Heard, through her lawyer, is now claiming that she can’t make those donations because of Johnny’s ongoing litigation.</p>
<p>""However, Amber has been delayed in that goal because Mr. Depp filed a lawsuit against her, and consequently, she has been forced to spend millions of dollars defending Mr. Depp's false accusations against her.""</p>
<p>And never mind that Heard was supposed to have made those donations 3 years before he ever filed suit against her.</p>
<p>Heard plans to fulfill those donations “eventually,” her lawyer says.</p>
<p>So, basically, Heard’s defense against being accused of not paying 7 million dollars to charity is to admit that she didn’t pay 7 million dollars to charity, and blame it on Johnny.</p>
<p>Keep on digging, Amber. Keep on digging.</p>

<p>The court in Fairfax, VA has issued an <a href=""https://www.fairfaxcounty.gov/circuit/sites/circuit/files/assets/documents/pdf/opinions/cl-2019-2911-depp-v-heard-01-24-21.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">Opinion Letter</a> dismissing most of Amber Heard’s counterclaim, and upholding only a few bits of it. But the parts where she mentions this petition say that:</p>
<p>“The allegations that “Mr. Depp has initiated, coordinated, overseen and/or supported and amplified two change.org petitions: one to remove Ms. Heard as an actress in the Aquaman movie franchise, and one to remove her as a  spokeswoman for L’Oreal” fails under the second prong of the VCCA. See Countercl. Paragraph 6. Nothing in that allegation implies facts showing that the change.org petitions included obscene language, threatened illegal or immoral acts, or suggest or propose obscene acts. See Va. Code 18.2-152.7:1. Likewise, the allegation that Mr. Depp “created, coordinated, controlled, and/or manipulated social media accounts created specifically for the purpose of targeting Ms. Heard,” also fails under the second prong of the VCCA. See VA code 18.2-152.7:1. The pleading fails to demonstrate that the social media accounts communicated obscene language, suggested obscene acts, or threatened illegal or immoral acts. Because neither of those allegations meet the second element of the VCCA, they cannot move forward in this litigation.”</p>
<p>So the court didn’t buy all that nonsense about Johnny Depp  being responsible for these petition and all us “Russian bots.” So even the court recognizes how ridiculous that claim was.</p>
<p>The only bummer about it is that now, I probably won’t be called to testify that Johnny Depp had nothing to do with the creation or maintenance of this petition. I was kind of looking forward to that.</p>
<p>There's a lot more to the letter, addressing more about Heard's counterclaim, but that's the part that deals with this petition.</p>

There isn’t any new news about Johnny Depp’s appeal in the high court of London regarding his libel suit against the Sun tabloid for calling him a Wife-Beater.</p>
<p>And there isn’t much new that’s going on in Fairfax county. A few new subpoenas or motions get posted now and again, laying all the groundwork. But nothing too earth-shattering.</p>
<p>Johnny seems to be upbeat, carrying on with the task of being fabulous Johnny Depp. There are whispers of upcoming projects that might include the Addams Family and maybe even Beetlejuice.</p>
<p>Amber Heard has been keeping up the appearance of being an active actress and relevant activist, putting her speaking services on the market. For a mere 30 grand a pop, you can hire Heard to give a motivational speech about surviving hardship, civil liberties, or some such.</p>
<p>Neither one of them seems to be addressing the upcoming defamation court case. Maybe there’s nothing new to talk about, or maybe they’re both playing the long game.</p>
<p>Me, I think it’s the calm before the storm. We still haven’t seen the majority of the footage from the Eastern Columbia building’s surveillance system, and we’re waiting with bated breath for the Toronto tapes. When those hit the public purview, nothing’s going to be the same.</p>
<p>Why didn’t we see this evidence in the Sun trial? Because the Sun had nothing to do with the Eastern Columbia building. The Sun had nothing to do with Toronto.</p>
<p>Too many people lost sight of the fact that the Sun trial wasn’t between Johnny Depp and Amber Heard. It was against Johnny Depp and The Sun. Amber Heard was only a witness.</p>
<p>The Fairfax, VA trial is between Johnny Depp and Amber Heard. As such, ALL the evidence comes into play. And I sincerely doubt that we’ve even scratched the surface with all the evidence we’ve seen so far. If I were on Johnny Depp’s legal team, I’d save the best for last, pulling out the aces when the time’s right. When it’s so damning that Amber Heard will have absolutely no defense. When it will well and truly screw her, finally revealing her for who and what she is, what she did, and holding her accountable for it.</p>
<p>We want to see the worst of it so that we can commiserate with Johnny and support him. But we also want him to prevail. We want him to win so that he can clear his good name, once and for all.</p>
<p>Wait for it, folks. Things might be quiet now, but I’m betting that the very best is yet to come.</p>","{'id': '225027246', 'petitionMedium': {'url': '//assets.change.org/photos/2/cj/hy/cqCJhyftbHttrMb-800x450-noPad.jpg?1609436145', 'processing': False}}",,,,against

<p>“This year has been so hard for so many. Here’s to a better time ahead. Happy Holidays, everyone! My love and respect to you all. Eternally, JD. X” He posted it with a picture of himself looking happy and well with Shane MacGowan on the set of the documentary Crock of Gold, which Depp produced.</p>
<p>That post has received over  1,965,562 likes.</p>
<p>On the flip side of the same token, Amber Heard was interviewed by <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uretrfMA-Io"" rel=""nofollow"">Access Hollywood</a> in a new video on YouTube talking about how she’s adapted and survived 2,000, including her legal troubles with Johnny Depp.</p>
<p>That video has received over 283,000 DISlikes.</p>
<p>Likewise, the comments on that video are heavily laden with sentiments supporting Johnny Depp, identifying with him as the victim of Amber Heard’s abuse. “They won’t believe you, because you are a man” many commenters post, due to an audio in which Amber Heard taunted Johnny saying that people wouldn’t believe that he was in fact an abuse victim. They call Amber out for portraying herself as the victim when the opposite is in fact true, by her own admission. “I was hitting you,” She confessed to Johnny on tape. And the public won’t let her forget it.</p>
<p>Considering the number of likes Johnny Gets compared to the number of dislikes and negative comments Heard gets, I think it’s pretty clear how the public feels about the two of them. </p>","{'id': '225018363', 'petitionMedium': {'url': '//assets.change.org/photos/5/wo/hd/UnwOHdPdbybJVaq-800x450-noPad.jpg?1609185161', 'processing': False}}",,,,against
StarterPetitionUpdate,28266946,2020-12-24T19:56:57.000Z,,dc-entertainment-remove-amber-heard-from-aquaman-2,Johnny Depp requests retrial,"<p>Johnny Depp has asked the Court of Appeal to order a retrial of his libel claim against The Sun over an article calling him a “wife beater”, which a High Court judge found was “substantially true”. Justice Nicol, the judge in the case, basically believed Amber Heard’s claims that she was abused, and found that the Sun, therefore, had every right to call Depp a “wife beater” on their front page.</p>
<p>Since this ruling, many tabloids, which I will not link to here, have run rampant, calling Depp a wife-beater and just about everything else in the book.</p>
<p>Johnny’s request for a retrial claims that he “did not receive a fair trial” and the judge’s ruling is “plainly wrong” and “manifestly unsafe”, according to documents filed by Mr. Depp’s legal team with the Court of Appeal.</p>
<p>Says David Sherborne, counsel for Johnny Depp: “The judge failed to properly assess [Heard’s] credibility by reference to documentary evidence, photographs, recordings or otherwise.” He further claimed that audio recordings of Mr Depp and Ms Heard while they were in a relationship demonstrated that “Ms Heard had not only been the violent one … but that she had also been untruthful in her oral evidence about the appellant’s violence”.</p>
<p>You can view the documents Johnny’s legal team filed on <a href=""https://www.nickwallis.com/courtofappeal"" rel=""nofollow"">Nickwallis.com</a>.</p>
<p>NGN will have to file a response and then a decision will be taken by a Court of Appeal judge on whether or not to allow the application (this can be done with or without a hearing). A decision could come down as early as January. If Depp’s request for a retrial is dismissed, it’s all over and Nicol’s judgment stands.</p>
<p>At that point, Johnny’s only recourse against his ex-wife (Heard) will be his upcoming defamation suit against her resulting from her op-ed in the Washington Post, in which she describes herself as a survivor of his domestic abuse. She doesn’t name him specifically in that piece, but she’s been naming him ever since their split in every other outlet, so her message was clear and obvious.</p>
<p>Here’s hoping the new year brings Johnny the vindication he deserves.</p>

StarterPetitionUpdate,28262754,2020-12-23T16:14:24.000Z,,dc-entertainment-remove-amber-heard-from-aquaman-2,Amber Heard AM2 role shrinking,"<p>Up until now, most of the fallout from Johnny Depp’s legal woes with ex-wife Amber Heard has been at Johnny Depp’s expense. Now, a lot of folks on the internet are campaigning to see Heard suffer the same treatment. In fact, the petition to remove her from Aquaman 2 is nearing a staggering 2 million signatures. And while WB has yet to announce any plans to hire another actress for the role, it seems that they’re trying to come up with a compromise.</p>
<p>With all of this going on, it looks like WB is gearing up to either reduce Amber Heard’s role in Aquaman 2 or write her out altogether.</p>
<p>According to Grace Randolph, the host of the “Beyond The Trailer” YouTube channel, the studio is bringing on another female lead to ‘balance things out.’</p>
<p>“Some of you are asking re Amber Heard – as I told you before, they are bringing on this new female lead to balance things out, and writing the script so that Heard’s role can be cut down if needed. But as of right now she’s still in Aquaman 2,” the journalist wrote on her Twitter feed. </p>
<p>As we learned last month, Warner Bros. may not be able to fire the London Fields star if it comes to it due to her contract. What they can do, however, is find a way to sideline her character in favor of a newcomer in Aquaman 2. To what extent they’ll do so, though, is anyone’s guess at this point.</p>
<p>Another source has maintained that al of this speculation is pointless, as Amber Heard has already been removed from Aquaman 2. If those sources are to be believed, it’s true that Amber Heard can’t be officially fired, but that she’s been bought out of her contract. Pretty much the same situation as Johnny Depp and Fantastic Beasts. They fired Johnny, but paid his contract. That’s what it’s rumored happened to heard. They basically paid her not to be in Aquaman 2.</p>
<p>Aquaman 2 is due to start shooting in Australia after the new year ahead of its scheduled release in December 2022. Time will tell if Heard will be involved. It’s entirely possible that the new female lead isn’t just being brought on board to “balance things out.” She might be Heard’s replacement.</p>
<p>Good.</p>

StarterPetitionUpdate,28247422,2020-12-19T17:12:14.000Z,,dc-entertainment-remove-amber-heard-from-aquaman-2,The latest,"<p>Two years to the day after Amber Heard published an editorial describing the backlash she faced as a domestic abuse survivor, a Virginia judge ordered the actress to produce her arrest record in the defamation case filed against her by ex-husband Johnny Depp.</p>
<p>Her arrest record, which involves an altercation with a different romantic partner more than a decade ago, is “crucial to key allegations in Mr. Depp’s complaint,” said the actor’s lawyer, Benjamin Chew of Brown Rudnick, during a hearing Friday in Fairfax County. </p>
<p>Thing is, though, that I’m pretty sure there have been more arrests than Heard’s 2009 arrest for domestic violence against her wife Tasya Van Ree. As I understand it, there have been a couple of DUI’s and rumor has it that there was at least one other arrest for domestic violence. I don’t know against whom, but it looks like we’re going to find out.</p>
<p>If this is true and Amber Has multiple arrests against her for domestic violence, it could be crucial in helping Johnny Depp establish that it was Heard who was violent in their relationship.</p>
<p>On the same day, a subpoena was issued to the ACLU, one of the organizations to which Heard swears she donated part of her 7 million dollar divorce settlement. It  has long been rumored that Heard didn’t donate to these organizations as she swore in her divorce documents, legal court documents, that she would.</p>
<p>I don’t know exactly what could happen to Heard if she kept the money and didn’t donate it, or didn’t donate all of it, like she said she would. Contempt of court, maybe? Or would this even be grounds for the divorce to be revisited? Could she owe that money back to Johnny? We’ll have to wait and see what the fallout is, but the fact is that she will now have to prove in a court of law what she did with that money.</p>
<p>If nothing else, it goes to her credibility if she swore to donate that money and didn’t. Not that her credibility holds much weight anymore.</p>
<p>Three days later, the court issued a subpoena for iO Tillet Wright, longtime friend and flying monkey of Heard’s. <a href=""https://www.fairfaxcounty.gov/circuit/sites/circuit/files/assets/documents/pdf/high-profile/depp%20v%20heard/cl-2019-2911-foreign-subp-prep-io-tillet-wright-12-18-2020.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">The service notice</a> doesn’t say whether it was Heard’s side or Johnny’s that requested the subpoena. It would be interesting to see who called iO. It’ll be even more interesting to see how far iO is willing to go to perjure himself for Heard. It’s one thing to lie to a court abroad where they can’t touch you. It’s another thing to perjure oneself in America where they can easily find you and level perjury charges. It’ll be interesting to see how far any of her friends are willing to perjure themselves.</p>
<p>It bears note that some of those previously pro-Heard folks are deleting their social media en masse. I don’t know if it’s related to the defamation case that’s looming ever larger, but it’s certainly possible.</p>
<p>By all accounts, it looks like Amber Heard’s legal world is crashing down on her. I wonder what her response will be when Johnny wins his defamation case, and then wins his appeal in the libel case he leveled against the Sun tabloid and subsequently lost. I wonder what the whole world’s reaction will be. So many have been so quick to vilify him. I wonder how quick they’ll be to vindicate him.</p>
<p>Time alone will tell.</p>

StarterPetitionUpdate,28238185,2020-12-17T17:45:23.000Z,,dc-entertainment-remove-amber-heard-from-aquaman-2,You can now hire Amber Heard to speak,"<p>Amber gets on board with Prince Harry &amp; Megan Markle’s public speaking agency. The public speaking agency is based out of New York, called The Harry Walker agency.</p>
<p>The agency has even made a statement regarding Amber’s entry into the agency. On their official website, Amber Heard is described her as “An outspoken advocate for women’s rights and for the civil rights of survivors of all gender-based violence around the world, Amber works with organizations that encourage survivors both personally and politically to come forward and reclaim their power. Amber makes frequent trips to DC to lobby and fight on behalf of the civil rights of women and the innumerable silent survivors of gender-based violence.”<br><br>If you’d like to hire her to speak at your event, she can be booked for the princely sum of $33,000. The agency describes her talks as “deeply moving” and says that hiring her is an excellent choice for a group or organization that’s looking for “some much-needed inspiration from a woman who walks day-to-day looking to be a contribution.”</p>
<p>There are, of course, those who would vehemently disagree. A large contingency of the public view Heard as a woman who abused her ex-husband Johnny Depp, as she admitted as much on audiotape. Those people find it ludicrous that Heard should dare to claim to be a spokesperson for survivors when she herself is an admitted abuser with a history of being arrested for domestic abuse against wife Tasya Van Ree in 2009.</p>
<p>Heard has already spoken at the Global Citizen Festival, the Social Good Summit and the L’Oreal Women of Worth awards, leading the reader to believe that Heard was paid to speak at those events. So, with a payday of up to $33,000 per appearance, her outpouring of heartfelt civic duty doesn’t exactly come across as altogether altruistic, does it? Rather, she seems motivated by the payday, which some would argue has always been her only impetus.</p>
<p>I for one will be interested to see how many people or organizations will hire Heard to speak for such a hefty payday. As more and more evidence comes out about the sort of person she really is, I can only imagine that this prospect will fail for her, just like all the rest of them do.</p>

I’m one of them. Anything that has Amber Heard in it gets a hard pass from me, and I can think of about 1.7 million people who feel the same way.</p>
<p>Instead, I suggest showing our support for Johnny Depp by watching something by Johnny Depp instead, whether it’s a DVD you already own, or picking a Johnny Depp movie on the streaming platform of your choice. There are lots of excellent movies to choose from, so it shouldn't be too hard finding a good one. Me, I'll probably be watching Pirates.</p>

StarterPetitionUpdate,28195245,2020-12-09T23:53:53.000Z,,dc-entertainment-remove-amber-heard-from-aquaman-2,Johnny dropped the N bomb to Ex Lori Anne Allison?,"<p>“Sources say he paid his first wife, Lori Anne Allison, $1.25 million to keep quiet after he allegedly left a long ranting message in which he repeatedly used the N-word. The previously unreported settlement was accomplished using fictitious names to avoid scrutiny.”</p>
<p>That’s just one of the many allegations put forth in an article published by The Hollywood Reporter. There are a ton of others, but I won’t dignify them by repeating them here. I’ll post the link because I have to cite my sources, but I’m hoping that you won’t give them any hits by clicking through to read it. It’s just all the same lies Amber Heard’s been spouting over the last few years.</p>
<p>I selected this statement to write about because this is the first time I’ve ever seen it. And because it’s so full of outrageous and flawed elements that I just had to pick it apart.</p>
<p>First, “Sources”? Really? Until or unless these “sources” are identified, it’s pretty hard to take anything that follows seriously.</p>
<p>Second, it doesn’t say WHEN this alleged payment took place. Johnny married Lori Anne more than 30 years ago. That’s a long stretch of road during which this alleged transaction could have taken place. They’re going to have to narrow it down a little more before it can be taken seriously.</p>
<p>Third, they also don’t say WHEN this long, ranting message took place. Was it back when they were together? Sometime since? Did he recently call Lori Anne out of the blue just to leave audio evidence of racial epithets nobody else on the planet has ever accused him of using? Just like I said a minute ago, they need to narrow down the timeline.</p>
<p>Fourth, when else has Johnny ever been accused of using language like that? Every? So we’re supposed to believe that he did it on tape just because some unnamed “sources” say so? Are we really supposed to be that gullible?</p>
<p>Fifth, where’s this message? If “sources” have heard it, why haven’t we? Are we supposed to believe that a tape like this exists and it hasn’t been leaked to the public?</p>
<p>Sixth, why in the world would Johnny Depp need to use a fake name to give his ex-wife some money? If Johnny wanted to give his ex some money, for whatever reason, there’s no reason whatsoever that he couldn’t just do so. He gave Vanessa money, too, and there’s nothing shady about it. By all accounts, he’s a generous guy. Why shouldn’t he be able to give his ex some money if he wants to?</p>
<p>I’m sorry, folks, but it doesn’t quite wash. They talk about scrutiny, but the fact is that there are far too few details for a claim like this to stand up to even the most casual scrutiny.</p>
<p>The point here, is that headlines like this are juicy and look damning on the surface, but you need to look a little deeper to determine if there’s any substance to back them up. This is just one among many allegations being tossed about in the press since the court in the UK ruled against him in his libel case against the Sun. The media’s been having a field day at Johnny’s expense, and there’s no more substance to those headlines than there are to this one. It’s just a bunch of fluffed-up rubbish set forth with no more justification than that someone said so.</p>
<p>Don’t take the headlines seriously, boys and girls, no matter how good – or bad – they look. There’s a good chance that it’s just a bunch of unfounded allegations being printed to sell papers. Or to get clicks online. That’s all. They, the papers, don’t care about the truth. If they did, they’d be exposing Johnny Depp’s abuser, proven by her own words, rather than serving the victim up on a platter the way they are. So don’t give them the satisfaction of giving their trash a second glance. Stick to the world of facts which have been proven, tried and true, by the abuser herself.</p>
<p>The truth will out in the end. It’s no coincidence that this article came out at the same time as Johnny applied to the higher court to move forward with his appeal to overturn the verdict in the Sun case. Like I said before, it’s all an agenda that’s being spoon fed to you. Don’t swallow it.</p>
<p>Keep your wits about you, folks, and keep fighting the good fight. We'll end up on the right side of the roaring rapids in the end.</p>

StarterPetitionUpdate,28173276,2020-12-05T17:52:18.000Z,,dc-entertainment-remove-amber-heard-from-aquaman-2,Steven Crowley and Amber Heard,"<p>Steven Crowley is an actor that knew and worked with Amber Heard on a movie called “Never Back Down.” He recently posted on <a href=""https://www.tiktok.com/@stevencrowley/video/6899955612692516101?_d=secCgsIARCbDRgBIAMoARI%2BCjwJwKV1Z7iPseiCnqcCqgorvxQKfKudCC6U7odEm%2BcVhDyZL7DW5DPEBlgxJ6RT3XEjlQvarTehNaYz1yEaAA%3D%3D&amp;language=en&amp;preview_pb=0&amp;sec_user_id=MS4wLjABAAAASEfHqDmQjy3OT_mgTD_dVC8Q2fpeea5FYcGo9DQOmhwG6MdY7e95hhOPSQMv1VQ8&amp;share_item_id=6899955612692516101&amp;share_link_id=702327CC-07B7-4399-BF29-AEB9E9D6537B&amp;timestamp=1606655972&amp;tt_from=copy&amp;u_code=d26ea8e5m5j667&amp;user_id=6602617470308057093&amp;utm_campaign=client_share&amp;utm_medium=ios&amp;utm_source=copy&amp;source=h5_m"" rel=""nofollow"">Tik Tok</a> that he has his own stories about Amber Heard and promised to do a YouTube about them. He posted a picture of himself and Amber Heard with the caption “Me trying not to get beat up every day on set for 3 months.”</p>
<p>Well, on December 2nd, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1x07aqi1-0&amp;feature=emb_title"" rel=""nofollow"">that video</a> went up on YouTube. Steven and his buddy Jason were chatting away, and then, about 12 minutes in, Steven starts talking about Amber Heard. He described first meeting her as sex personified, and so charming and overpowering that if she’d told him to go out and kill somebody, he would have done it. Not really, of course, but he was illustrating how much influence she can have on people, even at first sight. At least back then.</p>
<p>He went on to talk about Amber and the fights that she used to get into with her wife Tasya Van Ree, saying that they were real blow up fights. He also hinted at Amber’s drug and alcohol consumption as activities that he saw with his own two eyes.</p>
<p>Steven also talked about how Amber Heard was when she worked with Johnny Depp on the Rum Diary. Heard wasn’t even remotely interested in Depp. She was married to Tasya, but was well aware of Johnny’s interest in her, he said. It wasn’t until after another couple of movies failed, a tv show failed, then all of a sudden you hear about Amber Heard being with Johnny Depp, and wouldn’t you know it, she started getting parts.</p>
<p>Amber Heard was with Johnny Depp to further her career. That’s what Steven said without saying it.</p>
<p>Steven beat around the bush about a LOT of stories he said he could tell, but he was scared to death of getting sued if he told them. Jason assured Steven that the truth is the ultimate defense against a law suit, and that maybe these stories need to be told so that the world has both sides of the situation, not just the one that Heard is telling the world. Still, Steven hesitated and ultimately refused to say any more. The two agreed to talk about this more off-screen and then come back and revisit the issue in a future video.</p>
<p>What strikes me the most about the whole thing is how scared Steven was to talk about events he saw with his own two eyes. And, he said, there are a lot more people with stories to tell that are afraid to talk, too.</p>
<p>Why? Why are these people afraid of her? Because she’ll sue them? Like Jason said, the truth is the best defense against that. And it’s not just a matter of he say/She say if multiple people are stepping forward to corroborate each other’s stories. And I’m sure there are some people with photos or videos to back their stories up. They just have to work up the nerve to step forward and speak up.</p>
<p>All it takes is for one person to say “enough” and stand up. Once that first brave soul makes a stand and speaks out against Amber Heard, I think the floodgates will open up and everybody else who’s been holding back stories will come forward too. And it’ll be high time. This no-talent would-be actress has held her reign of terror long enough.</p>
<p>And I think that with the VA trial coming up, her web is going to start falling apart. She’s having to subpoena people who were previously willing to talk about her freely. I think they’re starting to realize what they’ve got to lose, and that her ship is sinking. And it is. The USS Amber Heard is taking on water, more every day. It’s only a matter of time until those rats start hopping off. I think we’re seeing it already.</p>
<p>By all means, go have a look at Steven Crowley’s <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1x07aqi1-0&amp;feature=emb_title"" rel=""nofollow"">video</a>. See for yourself all of the stories he hints at being able to tell about her, and witness how afraid he is to talk.</p>
<p>Let’s hope he’s the one that starts the ball rolling about Heard. It’ll make him a hero of epic proportions. He might just by a lynchpin if they get him involved with the VA case.</p>
<p>Come on, Steven. You can do it!</p>","{'id': '224939220', 'petitionMedium': {'url': '//assets.change.org/photos/6/jo/ak/VPJOaKaUxbgUdKR-800x450-noPad.jpg?1607190740', 'processing': False}}",,,,against

<p>Amber Heard admits in her own recordings that she repeatedly instigated physical fights with Johnny Depp and became enraged when he would often “split” to avoid the confrontation. She accused him of being a monster because he refused to stay and fight.</p>
<p>“The monster is back, this is him. Ran away at the first sign of trouble.” So the monster is not someone who hits her. The monster is someone who runs away at the first sign of trouble.</p>
<p>Hardly what Heard wanted the world to think, given her testimony. But it goes to show that not only is Johnny not the monster Heard apparently wanted everyone to believe, but also that the claims on this petition are also based in reality.  </p>

StarterPetitionUpdate,28137552,2020-11-28T20:40:54.000Z,,dc-entertainment-remove-amber-heard-from-aquaman-2,Dior sticks with Johnny Depp,"<p>Evidence suggests defiant Johnny Depp fans have been buying Dior’s Sauvage fragrance in support of the actor, who continues to be the face of the cologne despite a high court judge finding that he violently abused his ex-wife during their relationship.</p>
<p>Depp has been the face of the aftershave since it launched in 2015 with an advertising campaign that was criticized for its racist portrayal of Native Americans. But many were surprised to see an advert for the fragrance, featuring Depp playing a guitar, being shown on TV during The Great British Bake Off this week.</p>
<p>“We have received a total of 11 complaints about this ad,” a spokesperson for the Advertising Standards Authority said, “with the complainants believing that Johnny Depp shouldn’t be in the ad due to details concerning his recent court case.”</p>
<p>Depp was rumored to have been paid between $3m and $5m for the Sauvage advert.</p>
<p>Since the advert was broadcast, fans of Depp, using the hashtag #Justiceforjohnnydepp, have been posting messages of support on social media for the actor and Dior’s continued association with him. “Johnny Depp is still the face of Sauvage, because Dior aren’t idiots,” said one post. “Shout out to Dior for practically being the one sponsor left for Johnny Depp that hasn’t turned their back on him,” said another. “He’s still the face of their cologne Sauvage, definitely gonna get me a bottle to show my support.”</p>
<p>Asked if there was a chance Dior could use Depp again, Lauren Sherman, the chief correspondent for the Business of Fashion, said: “In the past, pre-social media, I would have bet on it. Now there is more to lose. It’s possible, but it’s riskier.”</p>
<p>Despite the shadow of “cancel culture”, Sherman said she thought Dior was taking the position of “all publicity is good publicity”.</p>
<p>“Most businesses like that take a long view, which is that growing awareness is good overall,” she said. “People will forget about the Depp association with time, but they may not forget the Sauvage name so easily.”</p>
<p>Dior has yet to comment, but ads continue to grace the airwaves. So I think we have our answer.</p>
<p>I, personally, am here to tell you that an overwhelming number of people have posted about their Sauvage purchases. Others have tried to purchase the brand, but have found it to be sold out. I think it’s safe to say that Dior made the right choice to keep Johnny Depp.</p>

StarterPetitionUpdate,28130001,2020-11-27T03:52:17.000Z,,dc-entertainment-remove-amber-heard-from-aquaman-2,Amber Heard in Pirates?,"<p>It’s not bad enough that Johnny Depp has lost the lead in the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise, has been asked to step down from Fantastic Beasts, lost his libel case against NGN and The Sun tabloid, and was denied his appeal. Now there are rumors that his ex-wife, Amber Heard, is in talks with Margot Robbie to appear in a remake of Pirates heavily laden with what Robbie calls “Girl Power.”</p>
<p>With this rumor about Pirates, what Heard insists will be her return to Aquaman 2 despite this petition that has more than 1.5 million signatures, and possibly a spinoff featuring Mera, her Aquaman role, it might look like Heard is riding high on a wave of professional success.</p>
<p>But let’s take a look at that, shall we?</p>
<p>First, there’s absolutely no substance to the rumor that Heard is getting anywhere near Pirates. Daniel Richtman said so on his Patreon account, and internet news sources have picked it up and run with it, but there’s no proof whatsoever. I could say that I’M going to be in Pirates, but that doesn’t make it true. Unfortunately, though, we live in a society where any tabloid rumor is considered news. But not everything you read is true, so don't take it on gospel just because it's on the internet.</p>
<p>Next, Aquaman 2. While Heard insists that she’ll be returning as Mera, there are a couple factors that make me doubt it. For one thing, the word through the grapevine is that WB bought out her contract. If that’s true, they paid her NOT to be in the movie. For another thing, the movie will shoot in Australia, where Heard is being investigated for perjury in relation to when she smuggled her dogs into the country in violation of Australia’s bio-laws. She could get arrested if she shows up there. And the main cast usually knows exactly when production is going to start, and all she can say is “Next year.” Nah, I sincerely doubt that Heard’s going to appear in AM2.</p>
<p>A Mera spinoff? There’s even less of a reason to believe that this is happening, and that’s saying something. There might have been a time when this idea was bantered about, which is understandable considering the popularity of the original film, and WB might be looking to ramp up their own girl power front. But now, with Heard’s troubles, I sincerely doubt that a spinoff is going to happen. You can see all of the reasons I gave above regarding her return to Aquaman. And you can add the whispers that Heard is unbondable, which would mean that she can’t be insured for filming. No insurance, no filming. Not for Pirates, AM2, and definitely not for her own film franchise.</p>
<p>No, folks. These rumors of all these great projects are just that. Rumors. Spoon fed to the media by someone with an agenda. It sounds like Heard is trying to not only obliterate her ex, Johnny Depp, in courts and in the press. It looks like she’s trying to replace him. What’s next? Heard being prominently featured in a Harry Potter film? It wouldn’t surprise me if that rumor started floating around, too.</p>
<p>Be careful what you believe in the press, folks. Until those rumors can be corroborated, take ‘em with a pinch of salt. The proof is in the pudding, and I’ve got a feeling that Heard is going to leave us all starving.</p>","{'id': '224909480', 'petitionMedium': {'url': '//assets.change.org/photos/0/cy/xp/ndCYXprYUnoLzox-800x450-noPad.jpg?1606449372', 'processing': False}}",,,,against
StarterPetitionUpdate,28123888,2020-11-25T21:23:15.000Z,,dc-entertainment-remove-amber-heard-from-aquaman-2,"Appeal denied, but there's still hope","<p>Johnny Depp was recently dealt a blow when he lost his libel case against NgN and The Sun tabloid. The Pirates of the Caribbean actor, 57, has also been ordered to pay £628,000 in legal costs to The Sun for his failed libel action against the newspaper.</p>
<p>But determined to see justice done, Johnny Depp wrote a note on his <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/CHQXHimJvAC/"" rel=""nofollow"">Instagram</a> saying that he intended to appeal. </p>
<p>The first step in the appeal process is to get permission to move forward with the appeal. As promised, Johnny did indeed file for an appeal. But I'm sorry to say that permission to move forward with the appeal was denied. By the same judge that found against him in the first place, (in)Justice Nicol.</p>
<p>Got that? The SAME JUDGE that found against Johnny in the first place turned down his bid for an appeal, saying that he did not believe that Johnny's appeal had a ""reasonable prospect of success. In any event, I do not consider that the proposed grounds of appeal have a reasonable prospect of success (and that is also the case so far as the grounds of appeal suggest that I erred in principle or in law) and there is not some other compelling reason why permission to appeal should be granted.""</p>
<p>In his ruling Mr. (in)Justice Nicol wrote: ""The findings of fact by a first instance tribunal (particularly one, such as myself, who has heard oral evidence) are rarely open to challenge on appeal.""</p>
<p>But that's not the end of Johnny's appeal. Apparently, going through (in)justice Nicol for the first part of the appeal was just a step that had to be taken as a matter of routine. Now, Johnny can take the case directly to the Court of Appeal.</p>
<p>That's the good news. Most likely, Johnny's appeal has every chance of being victorious, meaning that the original court finding will be overturned.</p>
<p>The bad news is that the appeal process could take as long as 2 years. Anything can happen in that time, and that's a long time for an actor to wait between roles, if the verdict is held against him in Hollywood.</p>
<p>Rumor has it though, that Robert Downey Jr is talking about including Johnny in an upcoming project. And Johnny is reportedly in talks about upcoming projects with Netflix. So Johnny's acting future might not be as dismal as it might seem with him booted from both Pirates and Fantastic Beasts 3. It looks like he'll rise above this nonsense.</p>
<p>Still, up to 2 years is a long time to wait.</p>

I don’t know why they have to be RUSSIAN bots. Why can't they be Mexican bots. Or Japanese bots. There are a lot of countries in the world. She can take her pick.</p>
<p>She’s also tried dismissing this petition as having no basis in reality. Yet she keeps bringing it up in court documents, both in the UK and VA cases. Which is it, I wonder? Seems like the poor thing can’t make up her mind.</p>
<p>One thing’s pretty clear, though. This petition bugs the everlovin’ sh*t right out of her.</p>
<p>Our little petition is under attack. Somebody (wonder who?) started spamming my comments with nasty comments last week, then reporting them as violations, trying to get the petition taken down for violating Change .org’s terms of service. And it might have come pretty close to working. For a few days, features of the petition were removed and altered. Some people couldn’t find the petition at all, and others weren’t able to sign it if they could.</p>
<p>Well, it didn’t work.</p>
<p>I got in touch with Change .org and took control of the petition back. I asked them to hide my comments for a while so that they can’t be spammed and then reported as violations. I don’t like that the comments are off, I like for people to be able to speak their minds. It bugs me that freedom of expression is being curtailed. 99% of the comments were from decent people who felt the need to speak out against injustice, abuse, and bad acting.</p>
<p>But people haven’t been put off by these recent actions, and the petition is still standing strong. No matter how hard somebody’s trying to make it, people are still finding the petition in droves.</p>
<p>By signing the petition, millions of people are speaking in one voice, saying that they do not want to see Amber Heard in Aquaman 2. And if she doesn’t like that, it’s kind of too bad. she can only blame herself. All I did was turn on a spotlight.</p>
<p>People might not be able to leave comments, for now, but we will not be silenced. The number of signatures keeps climbing, and more living, breathing people are signing all the time.</p>
<p>That speaks louder than words.</p>
<p>Also, this petition isn’t searchable on change .org anymore – not my doing - so it’s more important than ever to sign and share so that people can keep finding it. Thanks a bunch for hanging in there.</p>
<p>If nothing else, it’s worth it to know how very much we’re bugging her.</p>","{'id': '224893509', 'petitionMedium': {'url': '//assets.change.org/photos/2/bo/yg/rvboYGMNWdwzjms-800x450-noPad.jpg?1606070533', 'processing': False}}",,,,against
StarterPetitionUpdate,28102343,2020-11-21T15:05:10.000Z,,dc-entertainment-remove-amber-heard-from-aquaman-2,"Amber Heard can't be fired, claims.","<p>According to ScreenRant, WB can’t fire Amber Heard or even ask her to break her contract due to the legal issues involved in her dispute with Depp. In the United States, the plaintiff has to prove malicious intent by the reporter, as well as avoidance of the truth, in order to succeed in a defamation of character suit. However, in the UK system, the journalist in question has to prove to a court that they weren’t acting in bad faith and to justify the accuracy of their reporting.</p>
<p>So The Sun got away with it because all they had to do was say that they believed Amber Heard’s claims in good faith, not that she was telling the truth. And they’ve only gotten away with it until Johnny’s appeal goes through. When that happens, it’s going to be a whole different story.</p>
<p>When Johnny prevails in his upcoming defamation suit against ex-wife Amber Heard, it’ll be much harder for her to secure work, though word through the grapevine has it that she’s already unemployable already because she’s unbondable. So claims of her being case as the invisible girl, or appearing in a movie with Nicolas Cage (a LONG time Johnny Depp friend) are more than likely just that: claims. Unfounded in reality, to coin her phrase.</p>
<p>But then there’s her contract with WB regarding Aquaman 2. Perhaps it is true that she can’t be fired due to these legal proceedings. But that doesn’t mean she can’t be fired for other reasons. For example, most contracts these days have some sort of morals clause.</p>
<p>And that doesn’t mean that her contract can’t be bought out by WB. That’s a whole different circumstance. And reliable rumor has it that’s exactly what happened. So when you hear claims in the press that Heard’s position with WB is unshakable, or that she’s got ALL these roles coming up, take it with a pinch of salt. Just remember those claims that she was going to be in a live-action Hercules movie? Right. She and her PR team can cook up whatever claims they want. Doesn’t make them true.</p>
<p>And remember, when it comes to how things are worded in the press, just remember there’s more than one way to get things done. Take a look at the wording, then take a look around it. Just because she can’t be fired for one reason, it doesn’t mean she can’t be fired for another. And it certainly doesn’t mean that she’s going to be hired for anything new.</p>
<p>Time will tell.</p>
<p>What do you think? Would Amber Heard make a good invisible girl?</p>

StarterPetitionUpdate,28091945,2020-11-19T18:54:31.000Z,,dc-entertainment-remove-amber-heard-from-aquaman-2,Heard and Howell,"<p>If you don’t know who Jennifer Howell is, she’s Whitney Heard’s former boss and friend. She was dragged into the Johnny Depp v Amber Heard case when Whitney testified that she fled the situation and slept on Jennifer Howell’s floor. Jennifer spoke up and corrected Whit by saying that she never made Whit sleep on the floor. Since then, it’s come out that Whitney regularly confided in Jennifer about everything that was going on, including Amber being the bully in the staircase episode, and that Amber Heard took Johnny Depp’s finger off. These are crucial points, since Amber Heard painted Johnny Depp as the aggressor in both cases.</p>
<p>Originally, Amber Heard subpoenaed Jennifer Howell, likely expecting her to support her version of events, but was faced with the fact that Jennifer vows to tell the truth. That’s not a good thing for Amber.</p>
<p>So now, Johnny Depp’s team has subpoenaed Jennifer Howell.</p>
<p>Amber Heard’s team jumped all over that, petitioning the court to deny Jennifer Howell’s testimony, calling it irrelevant. But the court has denied that petition, saying that Jennifer Howell can definitely testify. This is the petition that the court called disingenuous, and sanctioned Amber Heard $4,732.50 for wasting the court’s time.</p>
<p>Court said that if Amber Heard thought Jennifer Howell was relevant enough to subpoena in the first place, she can’t turn around and say that Jennifer Howell is irrelevant just because Johnny’s team wants to subpoena her.</p>
<p>On Jennifer Howell’s Instagram, she says:</p>
<p>I was recently subpoenaed into a court case to tell the truth, and I did so. Verdict came down on Monday and the actual truth was destroyed by an unjust system.<br>I share this now because I want to have faith in truth, dignity, love and integrity ultimately winning. My heart has been broken during this process as I have lost faith in so many people who have claimed to be moral and good yet lack the integrity to tell the truth when it might be “an inconvenience” for them.<br>Those same people have contacted old employees of the charity and told them not to speak to attorneys and to dodge subpoenas. Have questioned my integrity for actually telling the truth when I was called to do so and much more. Heartbreaking to lose faith in people. I write this as I am trying not to lose faith in humanity, in justice and in the greater good... Truth and goodness have to win in the end.</p>
<p>The VA case is going to be a jury trial, and I have a feeling that they’re going to give Jennifer’s testimony a great deal of weight, considering she’s friends with the Heards, but is willing to tell the TRUTH regardless of the personal consequences to herself.</p>
<p>I for one can’t wait to see what Jennifer Howell says on the stand. It seems to me that her testimony will be a lynchpin in blowing Amber Heard’s lies wide open, as well as everybody else who lied for her. That puts them ALL in the hot seat for perjury charges not just for the VA case, but also the UK case as well.</p>
<p>Heard keeps digging her own hole deeper and deeper, and she’s dragging people down with her.</p>
<p>I personally think that it’s only a matter of time before those rats start jumping off her sinking ship. I should take bets for who jumps first.</p>
<p>Heard’s little world is crumbling down around her and she’s the only one that doesn’t see it.</p>

<p>Heard was also sanctioned fines that total more than $8,000 dollars, basically for wasting the court's time.</p>
<p>Heard's motions were characterized as disingenuous and nonsensical by the courts. </p>
<p>So it looks like the VA court is having none of Heard's antics, not only refusing her ""nonsensical"" motions, but also fining her for filing them frivolously.</p>
<p>These are good signs, people. Not only does it look like the court is not in Heard's pocket, but early signs are favorable towards Depp, which an unbiased court must be, considering his mountain of evidence, videos, witnesses, audio tapes, and so much more. </p>

You can see proof of service <a href=""https://twitter.com/An_elf_pirate/status/1325894501303545856/photo/1"" rel=""nofollow"">HERE</a>, <a href=""https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EmaGBLrWMAA14LQ?format=jpg&amp;name=large"" rel=""nofollow"">HERE</a>, and <a href=""https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EmaGBLuW4AIJGf4?format=jpg&amp;name=large"" rel=""nofollow"">HERE</a>. And it bears note that the plaintiff issued these subpoenas. Johnny Depp's lawyers, not Amber Heard's.</p>
<p>If you don't remember, Tasya Van Ree was Amber Heard's domestic partner, who Amber was arrested for assaulting in 2009.</p>
<p>We've all seen Rocky and iO lie for Amber, and even Tasya Van Ree once issued a statement downplaying the domestic violence incident. </p>
<p>What we haven't seen is Tasya Van Ree on the stand, under oath, willing to lie for Amber. And, really, she can't. She can try to downplay the incident, but she can't deny that it happened. And if the arresting officer is also called to testify, the severity of the attack will be on full display.</p>
<p>So the question becomes whether or not Van Ree will be willing to outright lie for her former partner, under oath, risking a perjury charge.</p>
<p>Were Rocky and iO called to the stand in the UK? Was Whitney? Was Josh Drew? How many of them will be willing to take the stand in America and commit perjury? The date for the VA trial is getting ever closer. It'll be interesting to see how many of them are willing to keep lying, or how many of those little rats start to jump ship as the date gets closer. Presumably, iO, Rocky and Van Ree have lives and livelihoods they don't want to risk losing by going to jail. And Whitney has a baby son she certainly doesn't want to leave so she can go and serve jail time for her abusive sister.</p>
<p>Truth is, Amber's little make-believe world is closing in around her. Whatever power it is she thinks she's got over people is fragile at best. People have a self-preservation instinct that's stronger than whatever sword of Damocles she's got hanging over their heads. </p>
<p>And, when the first rat cracks, the rest of them will hit the water like Ethel Merman choreographed it. Make no mistake about that.</p>
<p>Now, while Amber might be celebrating what she thinks is a win in the UK, that story isn't finished. Johnny is certain to win his appeal, even if it does take up to two years for the process to run its course. </p>
<p>And let's not forget that Amber's being investigated for perjury in Australia, and they're serious about putting her behind bars. Which begs the question, how is she going to travel to Australia to film Aquaman 2, as she claims, with that looming over her head?</p>
<p>Nah. I've heard that Warner Bros bought out her contract, and that's the information I'm running with. I'd bet dollars to donuts that she won't be AM2. </p>
<p>And I'm waiting to see which rat will jump ship first.</p>

Justice Nicol was a lawyer championing for freedom of press for The Times which is owned by Murdock Who employees his son. The Judge's son works with defendant DAN WOOTTON. This combined with other connections between the judge and Amber Heard set Johnny Depp up to fail from the beginning. That’s why Heard was so smug throughout the proceedings. She knew the whole time that she had it in the bag.</p>
<p>But Johnny is appealing the verdict, taking the decision out of Justice Nicol’s hands. Heard might be laughing out the other side of her butt when the appeal comes down in Johnny’s favor.</p>
<p>And let’s not forget the Defamation case coming up in Virginia. Unless that judge has ties to Heard, or has been paid off, that’s a slam dunk for Johnny. There’s a ton of evidence that wasn’t brought forth in the UK trial because it was the Sun in the Hot Seat, not Heard. She was just a witness in that case. In Virginia, she’s the defendant. A LOT of evidence and a myriad of witnesses will be brought that she’ll have a very hard time trying to disprove. Johnny’s got video, audio and witnesses. All Heard has is: “Because I say so.” That doesn’t fly in an unbiased court of law.</p>

<p>But the damage is done. Not just to Johnny, but every male survivor of domestic abuse. By finding against Johnny and his preponderance of evidence in the face of Heard's abysmal lack of evidence, by saying that he believed Amber Heard because she's a woman, the judge has made it impossible for abused men to come forward in search of support.</p>

<p>“Shut down this pathetic petition, Justice for Amber! Support women shame on you Jeanne.”</p>
<p>That right there is exactly what’s wrong with what’s going on right now. Amber Heard expecting people to believe her just because she’s a woman.</p>
<p>“Tell the world, Johnny. Tell them I Johnny Depp, a man, I'm a victim too of domestic violence... and see how many people believe or side with you.""</p>
<p>And at first, she was right. People did side with her just because she’s a woman. Even in the recent verdict in Johnny Depp’s libel case against the Sun, the judge ridiculously said that even though Johnny had the preponderance of evidence, he was choosing to believe Amber Heard. What woman would lie about being the victim of domestic abuse, right?</p>
<p>Well, we know the answer to that one, don't we?</p>
<p>Heard may be celebrating right now, but the libel case isn’t over. Not by a long shot. Johnny and his team have 21 days from the verdict date to appeal the verdict. And, according to Johnny’s legal team, the verdict is so absurd that it’s unthinkable not to appeal.</p>
<p>I can neither confirm nor deny that such an appeal will take place, so I’ll just suppose that it will. And if it does, the verdict must certainly be overturned.</p>
<p>Regarding Justice Nicol, it’s rumored that his wife is BFFs with one of Amber’s lawyers. If that’s true, can we say “conflict of interest” much?</p>
<p>As for me, no. I won’t support women just because they’re women. I will support VICTIMS no matter what gender they are. I support Johnny, a male victim of domestic abuse. I hope his verdict is overturned, so that men in the UK and around the world can feel safer coming forward seeking support. Nobody should feel so victimized by society that they can’t get help.</p>

<p>She said Waldman was responsible for disseminating audio recordings, surveillance pictures and declarations from third-party witnesses to websites and Twitter users.</p>
<p>In court on Friday, Heard’s lawyers accused Waldman of spreading false rumors about their client.  </p>
<p>White, who is chief judge of the 19th Circuit, agreed Friday to revoke Waldman’s pro hac vice status. Despite finding that ethical standards were violated, the judge declined to issue a gag order against Waldman.  </p>
<p>While it’s easy to see this as a defeat, it’s not. Not at all. Johnny has be represented by Virginia lawyer Benjamin Chew throughout these proceedings thus far, and he’ll continue to do a fine job. After all, whoever presents them, the facts are still the facts, and Amber Heard is still sunk by them. She can’t get everybody fired.</p>
<p>Besides, now that Adam Waldman isn’t constrained by the orders of the case anymore, he can say and do whatever he wants. The judge didn’t issue a gag order remember, and Waldman knows EVERYTHING about the case. While I’m sure he wouldn’t do anything to hurt Johnny – he’s still Johnny’s lawyer – he’s now free to talk about any little thing.</p>
<p>Heard may see this as a victory, but the truth is that she may have shot herself in the food on this one. Waldman’s free to talk, now, and I for one can’t wait to see what he’s got to say.</p>

<p>Aside from Incredibly average, I had seen one or two videos by <a href=""https://t.co/wakbRHTk82?amp=1"" rel=""nofollow"">eHacker</a>, because they did one on the petition. Come to find out, they've got a lot to say on the subject of Heard V Depp.</p>
<p>At that time, though, I wasn’t aware that there were YouTubers that were doing live streams chatting about the events surrounding Johnny Depp versus Amber Heard.</p>
<p>Then I was invited to be a guest on a live chat with Stevie J Raw. At first I declined, because I really didn’t think I was important enough to have anything relevant to say. But then I was reminded that it would help raise awareness for the petition, which raises awareness for not only Johnny Depp, but also other male victims of domestic abuse. So I agreed and I went on Stevie’s live stream.</p>
<p>I think I was an idiot, but Stevie was an extremely gracious host, and everybody was so supportive. They made it painless. <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZRUgYEhu4"" rel=""nofollow"">HERE</a>’s the link to that video, if you want to see for yourself that I’m not a bot, curls and all.</p>

StarterPetitionUpdate,27923120,2020-10-20T20:42:33.000Z,,dc-entertainment-remove-amber-heard-from-aquaman-2,Amber Heard's fate has gone to the dogs,"<p>The Department of Agriculture in Queensland, Australia is investigating Amber Heard for possible perjury over the Pistol &amp; Boo star-paws palaver. Hound lovers may recall that during the Pirates of the Caribbean star’s libel case against The Sun newspaper, Depp’s former employee told the court he was forced to lie under oath about the dogs’ illegal entry into Queensland. Heard’s former assistant also claimed the actor “deliberately smuggled the dogs into Australia.”</p>
<p>The 34-year-old Heard avoided conviction in April 2016 after she pleaded guilty to giving Customs a false document. But she and Depp were forced to film a hostage video, sorry, biosecurity apology. </p>
<p>The department is investigating if any criminal offences under commonwealth legislation have been committed relating to the testimony provided to the High Court in London. As the matter is the subject of a current investigation the department is unable to provide any further comment at this time.</p>
<p>The maximum penalty for perjury in Queensland? Fourteen years in jail. “Is the defense for perjury that you have got to be able to act?” Joyce zinged. “What is the point of having laws if they are not pursued?”</p>
<p>That’s right, folks. Heard could face up to 14 years in jail for one count of perjury alone.</p>
<p>That doesn’t even begin to touch the time she could serve if Johnny filed a complaint about his finger and had her thrown in jail for assault resulting in grievous bodily injury. If he did that, we wouldn’t have to be bothered with Miss Thang for quite a while.</p>
<p>I don’t know why Johnny hasn’t filed a complaint yet for that finger incident, but I wish he would, and make her face justice for it, once and for all.</p>
<p>What do you think? Should Johnny put Heard in jail for cutting off his finger? Or should he let sleeping dogs lie?</p>

StarterPetitionUpdate,27902300,2020-10-16T18:48:02.000Z,,dc-entertainment-remove-amber-heard-from-aquaman-2,Amber Heard bullies Johnny Depp,"<p>Johnny Depp is ordered to appear for three successive days in counsel for the defendant’s offices on November 10th, 11th, and 12th, beginning at 10am. And he has to pay her the cost of filing this motion, as well as whatever other reasonable costs apply.</p>
<p>So, basically, Johnny has to pay Amber for bullying him into interrupting filming in London in order to appear in Virginia for a deposition that easily could have waited until after his filming was concluded.</p>
<p>Let’s keep in mind that it’s not just three days at stake. There are quarantine periods as well. So it’s not just a matter of days that filming is being disrupted by. It could be weeks.</p>
<p>While I’m sure it’s Amber’s intention to jerk Johnny around – maybe even get him fired from FB3 – she’s also meddling with WB, forcing them to reschedule Johnny’s filming and having to film around him. Is this something she’d pull if she were still affiliated with Aquaman 2? I don’t think so. She wouldn’t risk her status with them if she still had the part.</p>
<p>Heard might be feeling all victorious right about now, winning this little battle. But one battle doesn’t win the war, and she will not win this one. The verdict will come down from London soon about Depp’s libel case against the Sun for calling him a wife beater, and when it does, the whole world will be put on notice that the courts aren’t buying her story about being a battered wife. The court in London won’t buy it, and neither will the court in Virginia.</p>
<p>She can enjoy what little bit of money she gets from Johnny right now, right up until she’s forced to pay him $50 million for his defamation case. Since she’s not worth that much to begin with, it’ll be interesting to see where she gets the money.</p>
<p>She can enjoy pushing him around for now, too. Because while she’s getting her way this time, she does no control Johnny Depp any more. He caught wise to what kind of a monster she really is, and kicked her to the curb. Sure, he’ll have to sit for the deposition, but she will not be the one asking questions. She shouldn’t even be in the room, though I’m sure she’ll find a way to insert herself so that she can stare him down and witness his defeat. But that’s the end of it. He’s moved on with his life and regained his happiness. And no matter how much she thinks she can push him around, she can’t take that away from him. Never again.</p>
<p>And she can go ahead and enjoy breathing free air, while she can. She’s got several chances to be thrown behind bars hanging over her head. First, there’s no statute of limitations in Australia for violence that results in grievous bodily harm. Like cutting off somebody’s finger. The only reason she hasn’t been brought up on charges is because Johnny hasn’t filed a claim against her. She owes the fact that she’s not in jail right now to the man she’s pushing around. She needs to think about that.</p>
<p>Second, Australia’s looking at her for Perjury in the case where she brought the yorkies, Pistol and Boo, into the country illegally. She lied in her statement to authorities, and now they know it.</p>
<p>And, depending on how the verdict comes down in London, she could very well be facing perjury charges there, too. She lied her ass off in her testimony to the British courts, just like she’s lied for the past four years about Johnny.</p>
<p>Will they seek perjury charges in Virginia after she lies there, too? They certainly could. So let her do her little victory dance at this perceived victory. She won’t be laughing when it’s all over.</p>
<p>What do you think? Will the London judge rule in favor of Depp or Heard? What do you think will happen in Virginia? Will Heard manage to pull another rabbit out of her hat? Or will Johnny prevail, clearing his name and forcing her to face justice? Drop a comment and let us know.</p>

<p>If I were so inclined, I could post pictures of the inane things Amber Heard's been up to, from riding her horse, and a lesson horse, badly with the wrong tack, to her hanging her nipples out for the world to see (again) in that same see-through top that she wore to meet Jason Momoa and a gaggle of kids for an Aquaman event.</p>
<p>But I'm not so inclined. It's not news, even if these base, nonsensical tidbits get posted in the Daily Fail (mail) tabloid.</p>
<p>I have to wonder who she's got on her payroll to get them to post her non-event, inappropriate photos. SOMEbody's got to be getting paid for that. It also makes me wonder who's footing the bill. She got paid not to appear in Aquaman 2, so she's got a little bit of money. But she lives outside her means, and somebody's got to be picking up the tab. </p>
<p>Hopefully, we'll hear a ruling soon. Then we can celebrate, since Johnny is certain to win. And then we can look forward to the Virginia case, which Johnny is also certain to win, hands down. Heard spend years portraying herself as the victim of Depp's abuse, when the truth is that she was the abusive one. He lost his job as Captain Jack Sparrow due to her allegations. It's only right that he should be compensated for it. </p>
<p>As much as I enjoy updating this petition and interacting with all of you, this petition was created to be temporary. When it's confirmed beyond any doubt that Heard isn't in Aquaman 2, I can claim this petition to be a victory and put it to bed. </p>

<p>First, she fails to state a claim for declaratory judgement. In her opposition, Ms. Heard fails to state a single case recognizing the viability of a standalone claim for a declaratory judgement. Basically, she's outta gas because of anti-SLAPP statutes.</p>
<p>Second, Ms. Heard fails to allege computer crimes under the VA code. She can't cite where the alleged ""smear campaign"" is immoral or unlawful. Further, she can't prove that anything said by Mr. Depp was obscene or illegal as it relates directly to her.</p>
<p>And third, calling someone a liar isn't defamation. Especially if they've already been proven to be a liar.</p>
<p>In short, Heard's counterclaim is a whole bunch of her being butthurt, without any legal substance. </p>

<p>She says that “Throughout this litigation, Mr. Waldman has acted like anything but an attorney this Court has a right to expect.”</p>
<p>In her memorandum, Heard insists that Mr. Depp has defamed her through Mr. Waldman’s statements as Mr. Depp’s agent, and has orchestrated a robust social media campaign against her through the use of inauthentic social media accounts (i.e. not real accounts by real people) casting aspersions on Heard while often praising Mr. Depp and Mr. Waldman. The conduct for which Defendant now seeks sanctions is related but distinct from the conduct alleged in Heard’s counterclaims.</p>
<p>What that means is that this isn’t the same assertion she made in her counterclaim, this is a completely new motion asking the court to make Mr. Waldman stop posting on social media.</p>
<p>More than that, it looks like she’s trying to get Adam Waldman thrown off the case all together, saying that “the court has the right to revoke the pro had admission of Depp’s lawyer (Waldman), if his behavior on social media adversely impacts the administration of justice.”</p>
<p>Admission pro hac vice is when a lawyer from another jurisdiction is allowed to practice in another area. Virginia isn’t Adam Waldman’s normal stomping ground, so Heard wants him thrown off the case.</p>
<p>The reasons she says he should be dismissed aren’t just his actions on social media. She also blames Waldman for leaking Josh Dre’s deposition transcript. She goes on and on about Waldman on Twitter, having puppies and kittens about other “leaked” materials and laundered information.</p>
<p>What it really means is that Waldman’s doing his job, Heard can’t stand it, and she’s doing everything she can to get rid of him.</p>
<p>It also looks like she’s so jealous of Johnny’s popularity on social media that she can’t see straight. He gets hundreds of thousands of “likes” on his Instagram posts, none of which have had a single thing to do with her.</p>
<p>On top of asking for all these sanctions, Heard also asks the court to award her the cost of filing these motions in the first place. She wants to fling mud at Depp and his legal team, and she wants Depp to pay for her to do it. Talk about nerve.</p>
<p>What do you think? Will she be successful in getting rid of Adam Waldman? Or will the court tell her to sit down and shut up? Yeah, me too.</p>

Specifically, she’s going to have to prove how much of her divorce settlement was actually donated to charity, where it went and how much.</p>
<p>From court documents:  </p>
<p>“Second, discovery into whether Heard did, in fact, as she publicly claims, donate her $7 million divorce settlement to charity, is relevant to Ms. Heard’s motive in making the domestic abuse allegations against Depp. Defendant proclaimed to the world that “money played no role” in her divorce with Mr. Depp, promising that all settlement proceeds would be donated to charity, particularly to vulnerable and abused populations. Mr. Depp should be able to show that Ms. Heard’s false abuse claims were to leverage a larger settlement, that she did not donate the entirety of the proceeds. In connection with a third-party subpoena pending before the Hon. Stephanie M. Bowick of California, that court has already tentatively agreed with Depp that Heard put her donations at issue, and that the truth of Heard’s claims to have donated the settlement proceeds is relevant and discoverable. This evidence is directly relevant to Heard’s motives, and the motion is nothing more than a blatant attempt by Heard to end run a well warranted adverse ruling in California.”</p>
<p>Depp’s legal team submitted a motion to discover whether or not Heard had actually donated all of the money, and Heard’s team objected. But in yet another win for Johnny, a judge agreed with him. Details about the settlement are relevant to Heard’s motives in making abuse allegations against Depp.</p>
<p>So, in short, Heard is going to have to prove where the divorce money went. Did she donate it? Did she donate part of it and keep the rest for herself? Did she donate any of it?</p>
<p>Her little world is getting smaller and smaller, and she’s running out of places to hide.</p>","{'id': '224629804', 'petitionMedium': {'url': '//assets.change.org/photos/2/gi/bz/FHgibZxNfXsmhDy-800x450-noPad.jpg?1600901910', 'processing': False}}",,,,against
StarterPetitionUpdate,27768858,2020-09-22T19:23:15.000Z,,dc-entertainment-remove-amber-heard-from-aquaman-2,Amber Heard NOT confirmed for Aquaman 2,"<p>According to an interview with James Wan, the director of Aquaman and AM2:</p>
<p>""The official cast of Aquaman 2 hasn’t been revealed however, nonetheless, we do know that Jason Momoa will reprise his place of Arthur Curry / Aquaman. Other than him, Patrick Wilson who carried out the place of Orm Marius / Ocean Grasp (Arthur’s half-brother and former king of Atlantis) will even make his return, and in response to him, ‘Wan’s concepts for Aquaman 2 are pushing it even extra.’ Yahya Abdul-Mateen II has moreover confirmed his return and whereas others are however to be revealed, we anticipate to see Willem Dafoe, Amber Heard, and Nicole Kidman once more in movement as properly.""</p>
<p>Anticipated. Not confirmed.</p>
<p>While WB might never make an official statement that Heard has been bought out and dropped from the film, there are a LOT of clues that hint at it, from a statement on court that Heard was SUPPOSED to be in AM2 to this, a statement from the film's director that doesn't confirm that she's in it. </p>
<p>The biggest clue of all might come from her countersuit against Johnny Depp, wherein she claims to have lost a total of $100 million in salary and damages because of him. The only major payday she had on the line was Aquaman. So she's saying she lost Aquaman 2 because of Johnny Depp, right?</p>
<p>Aquaman 2 is due to be released on 16th December 2022. We might have to wait until then for proof that she's not in the film.</p>
<p>What do you think? Will it take the film coming out without her in it before you believe that she's out? Or are the clues enough? Me, I believe that she's out because I believe the sources that say so - and no, I won't name them, so don't ask. They're insiders in the industry, and haven't been wrong yet.</p>
<p>If only they could CGI her out of the first one, I'd be able to enjoy it.</p>

<p>Depp is also scheduled to reprise his role of Gellart Grindelwald, with filming on Fantastic Beasts 3 to resume filming any day now. Filming should be finished just in time for Depp to gear up for his Defamation trial against ex-wife Amber Heard, now scheduled to commence on May 17th, 2021.</p>

These documents include correspondence between Johnny and:<br>(his sister) Christi Dembrowski<br>Ben King<br>Kevin Murphy<br>Jerry Judge<br>Nathan Holmes<br>Malcolm Connelly<br>Steven Deuters<br>any other security for Mr. Depp<br>Mick Doohan (owner of the Australia house)<br>House personnel<br>Housekeeping<br>Personal assistant staff</p>

<p>She doesn’t want much, does she? Basically, she’s asking for any communication he ever had with anybody on the planet during that time that was about her.</p>
<p>She probably thinks that she’s going to find some incriminating morsel that she can wave around as proof that he’s a monster. But more likely, I think this fishing expedition is only going to find correspondence that corroborates Depp’s version of events.</p>
<p>Even more likely, Heard is asking for this staggering amount of communication to create even more of a paper blizzard to try to bury the facts in this case, that she defamed Johnny Depp by calling him a domestic abuser. No amount of paperwork is going to eradicate the fact that she’s doomed when it comes not only to the verdict in London, but in the VA defamation case as well.</p>
<p>See, when it comes to light that she perjured herself in London, that fact comes straight to Virginia, and applies directly to Depp’s defamation case against her.</p>
<p>It’s my guess that she’s trying to get ahead of the London verdict, which looms near, and kick up such a paperwork dust storm that she can hide her apparent guilt.</p>
<p>Not gonna work. But she’ll have to find that out for herself.</p>

And, according to this report, the trial is set to take 4 weeks. </p>
<p>That's 4 weeks to wade through all of Heard's ridiculous accusations against Johnny Depp, and Johnny's mountain of evidence proving that she's a liar. And, more than that, that she was the abuser in the relationship. I know it and you know it, but Johnny's got to prove it to the judge and jury. Is 4 weeks long enough for all that?</p>
<p>That's something else that's different from the London trial. This one's marked to be a trial by jury at the request of both parties. Looks like Heard thinks that she can convince them with her horrible acting and obviously fake testimony.</p>
<p>They're already looking at Heard for Perjury in Australia. It's possible that the UK will be looking at her for Perjury once the London verdict comes down. I wonder what the sentence for perjury is in the United States, particularly Virginia. Anybody know?</p>
<p>The statute of limitations is over in America for everything Amber Did to Johnny, Tasya, Kate James, Whitney, and all the other victims she's left in her wake, so she won't do any time for any of those crimes. </p>
<p>There is no statute of limitations in Australia, though, for any assault resulting in grievous bodily harm. She will have the possibility of serving time in Australia for cutting Johnny's finger off for the rest of her life. </p>
<p>And, more recently, she's racking up quite a list of places where she can and should be charged for perjury. Oh, how I hope they take turns locking her up for it. </p>

The trial was set for Jan. 11, which coincides with the filming schedule for another installment of the “Fantastic Beasts” series in which Depp will star, prompting his lawyers to request a continuance last month. But Heard objected to the delay.  </p>
<p>According to Heard, she was told that Aquaman 2 would start filming in February, 2021. See that claim <a href=""https://depplady.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/delay1.jpg?w=740"" rel=""nofollow"">HERE</a>.</p>
<p>Problem is that she’s all wrong.</p>
<p>WB wrote a letter regarding both FB3 and AM2, which says that they “require Mr. Depp to be in the United Kingdom from September 17th 2020 through the anticipated end of production in mid-February 2021.”</p>
<p>“As to Aquaman 2, that film will not start production any earlier that May 31, 2021.”</p>
<p>Notice how they name Johnny Depp and specifically address his filming schedule. But they don’t name Amber Heard or address her filming schedule. They refer to AM2 as “that film” and make no reference to Heard at all.</p>
<p>It also goes to show that Heard is completely out of the loop with regard to AM2 production. She thought filming was going to start in February, when in fact, production is going to start months later. Seems to me if she were going to be involved with the movie, she would have been informed by now. All the principals have to know these things early so they can schedule accordingly.</p>
<p>From the look of it, Heard has no idea whatsoever what’s going on with AM2. If she were returning as Mera, she’d be in the loop.</p>
<p>I’m taking it as a good sign that Heard’s out of AM2, straight from the horse’s mouth.</p>

These include:</p>
<p>1. All documents or communications with Mr. Depp that refer or relate to Ms. Heard<br>2. All documents or communications concerning the relationship between Mr. Depp and Ms. Heard, including, but not necessarily limited to any violence or abuse between Mr. Depp and Ms. Heard.<br>3. All documents or communications concerning any actual, alleged, or attempted acts of violence involving Mr. Depp.<br>4. All documents or communications concerning any actual alleged, or attempted alcohol or drug use or abuse by Mr. Depp from 2013 to present.<br>5. All documents of communications concerning any actual or alleged act of Mr. Depp that resulted in damage to property.<br>6. All documents concerning any decision to cast or not cast Mr. Depp in any future Pirates of the Caribbean films.<br>7. All contracts with or relating to Mr. Depp relating to the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise.<br>8. All documents or communications relating to any interviews, communications, or correspondence with press or entertainment trade publications concerning Mr. Depp.<br>9. All non-privileged documents or communications concerning any insurance policy or claims relating to any performance by Mr. Depp.</p>
<p>I hardly know where to start. So I’ll just start at the top. Any communications with Depp that relate to Ms. Heard. Why the hell would there be any communication between Disney and Ms. Heard? Does Heard’s team think that Johnny regularly chatted up Disney about his marriage? That’s ridiculous. Disney isn’t any one person, it’s a legal entity that exists on many levels, none of which includes marriage counseling. If there’s any communication, it’s from Disney telling Johnny that his wife was banned from the set because she was such a troublemaker during filming.</p>
<p>Number 2, same thing. There’s no reason there would be communications between Johnny and Disney about Heard at all, let alone anything about violence. But this is a slippery slope for Heard. IF there were any communications about violence, they are most likely about her being violent, not him.</p>
<p>Number 3, asked and answered by number 2.</p>
<p>Number 4, any actual alleged, or attempted alcohol or drug use or abuse by Mr. Depp. First, it’s ridiculous to think that Disney babysat Johnny while he filmed, to know what he did or didn’t do or drink. It would only be addressed if any such substance abuse became a problem for filming. Johnny is a consummate professional. We’ve never heard that he was drunk on set. Just that he’s a delight to work with. And secondly, what the hell is ATTEMPTED alcohol or drug use? That’s such an absurd phrase that I’m surprised any lawyer dared to put such a silly thing in actual court papers. Well, I guess they’ll do anything they’re paid to do.</p>
<p>Number 5, Damage. What do they think? That Johnny wantonly went around smashing sets? For one thing, we would have heard about it in tabloids at the time. For another, Disney wouldn’t have kept employing him if he were prone to smashing things up. They didn’t dump him until Heard branded him as a wife-beater.</p>
<p>Number 6, Any decision to cast or recast him in future films. That’s not a legal argument, it’s a personal fishing expedition. Yes, Johnny’s asking for 50m because that’s what he’s out for losing Pirates, but it reads more like she’s just desperate to know what work he’ll be getting.</p>
<p>Number 7, Asked and answered by number 6.</p>
<p>Number 8, This is far too broad a request to be feasible. Any interviews, EVER, relating to Disney? Besides, what has his interviews got to do with her defaming him? This comes across as Amber trying to create such a fuss with Disney that they won’t want to work with Johnny because of her. I hope the studio, and the judge, see through this abusive tactic and sent her packing.</p>
<p>Number 9, any insurance policy or claims relating to any performance by Mr. Depp. I find this one to be really interesting. The way filming works is that actors have to be bonded, insured, in order to film. Can’t film without being insured. So we already know that Johnny was insured for all past jobs with Disney or they wouldn’t have happened. So this is another fishing expedition to find out if Johnny is insured for future projects, Pirates or otherwise. She’s desperate to know what work he might have lined up with Disney in the future. It reeks of her wanting to know so that she can muck it up for him. I also think this request for his insurance information is highly ironic, since Heard herself is uninsurable. It reads to me like she's saying, “If I can’t work, neither can he!”</p>
<p>Remind me again, who was the abuser here? Her supporters would say that he’s the abuser by insisting upon these two court cases: the libel case in London and the Defamation case against her in VA. But let’s not forget that during negotiations for their divorce, he BEGGED her to finish it up quietly to avoid court. He didn’t want to hurt her reputation, he wanted to let her walk away. But it was SHE who kept running her mouth to any outlet she could think of, or pay for, labeling him as an abusive spouse and painting herself as the poor, embattled victim. She tried to ruin him, and she’s still trying to ruin him. Only now, it’s not just the public that gets to decide. It’s a judge and a court, and they’re not as gullible as I’m sure she hopes they are. A few flimsy lies aren’t going to hold up. They’re too easily debunked, and that’s what’s going on. Johnny is presenting evidence that he didn’t do what she says he did. She’s just hoping that if she throws enough paperwork into the air, it’ll distract away from the evidence.</p>
<p>Sorry, kid, but it doesn’t work that way. Those judgments are coming, sooner than later. And there’s not going to be anywhere to hide.</p>

<p>As things stand right now, Depp is scheduled to sit for his deposition on October 5th, most likely via video link, though that's almost certain to change.</p>
<p>Depp has filed for a continuance to allow for his filming schedule for Fantastic Beasts 3. Heard, naturally, is having fits about it. She thinks that Depp should be able to schedule his filming around court obligations, saying that Depp ""has made no effort to schedule around his deposition and this trial. The case needs to end, and end soon.""</p>
<p>That's not the way things work, of course, but there's no telling Heard that. She claims that Johnny and his lawyer Adam Waldman are waging a ""campaign of terror"" against her by posting on social media, and she calls for this abuse to end as soon as possible. And never mind that it is she who's been slandering him by way of every public platform that she can think of (or pay for) since they divorced. For her, it seems, it's ""Do as I say, not as I do.""</p>
<p>The thing is, they want five days for Depp's deposition, which Depp's side has argued is too long. They are also refusing to allow him to depo in London via WebX because AH wants a lawyer there, which would require 14 day quarantine period. </p>
<p>So while Heard is screaming about postponements, SHE'S the one making it difficult for him to sit for his deposition. </p>
<p>What do you think? Is Johnny dragging his feet by asking for a continuance? Or is Heard continuing to try to control and manipulate him? </p>

<p>Amber said that nobody would believe that she abused Johnny because he's so much bigger than her. I think she used the words 'twice her size.' Looking at this picture, you can see that it's not exactly true.</p>
<p>I understand that she was probably wearing heels for this photo, but still. It's not like he towers over her. She's as tall as Johnny, or nearly as tall, and we know that weight has nothing to do with someone's ability to throw a haymaker. Her argument about him being twice her size just doesn't wash.</p>
<p>Something else about this picture I can't help noticing is how smug she looks, while he looks miserable. Like many of the photos of them together from the time they were together, he looks like he's withdrawn, trapped, and begging for help with his eyes.</p>

<p>“My impression of him was a very loving and very sensitive and very trustworthy person,” Rylance said of Depp. “Intensely, intensely shy. You know? Like Daniel Day-Lewis and so many great actors are. The accusations that were around at the time we were making the film were of physical violence. And he obviously denied this and I found his denial completely believable. It didn’t seem to be part of his character at all.”</p>
<p>Likewise, Snoop Dogg is feeling the Johnny love.</p>
<p>It’s nice to see more and more people stepping forward with support for Johnny Depp. I think it’s finally sinking in that he was the innocent party, and that Amber Heard is the one who was abusive in the relationship.</p>
<p>Hell, she still is being abusive, asking to be informed about just about every minute of every day of his life. She’s even demanding his call sheets for filming, which are usually not even typed up until the day before filming. She’s contacting WB about him, demanding information. It seems to me that she’s trying to pester WB into firing Johnny because SHE’S too much of a pain in the arse for them to keep dealing with.</p>
<p>And that begs the question: IF Amber were still an Aquaman, how would this pestering bode for her. Nah, folks. This sounds like somebody who’s got nothing to lose from WB, meaning she’s already out of Aquaman.</p>
<p>It also comes across as Amber being insanely jealous that Johnny still has his blockbuster franchise, while she’s out of hers.</p>
<p>Maybe she should have thought of that before she beat the shit out of Johnny and then caused herself to be unbondable. She might still have the job.</p>
<p>She had the kindest, nicest guy on the planet, and she couldn’t keep from ruining that buy abusing him. Then she had one of the biggest film franchises on the planet, and she wrecked that, too. Poor little psycho just can’t keep hold of a good thing, can she?</p>

She says that his need to work is not “good cause” for a continuance, and that if the court grants one, it will set a “highly problematic” precedent. He could, and should have worked his filming schedule around his deposition instead. She thinks, apparently, that Depp has the power to make a multi-million dollar film, its cast, crew, and schedule revolve around him, at her whim.</p>
<p>Doesn’t work that way. It would cost millions for the movie to wait for him to go to court, if that were even possible. Court is flexible. Filming a movie is not.</p>
<p>Heard also says that it is of the utmost importance that the trial proceed as scheduled so that she can put a stop to Depp’s “daily” smear campaign of her through social media.</p>
<p>More than that, she bemoans the cost of maintaining her legal defense for an additional five months, the amount of time Depp is seeking.</p>
<p>She says that requesting a continuance, in part, because of Covid protocols, shouldn’t happen because even though it is good cause, it’s already been done twice. Apparently, she thinks twice is enough, and never mind that the pandemic is far from being resolved.</p>
<p>With regard to filming schedules, Heard says that she was told that Aquaman was going to start filming sometime in the spring – WB didn’t tell her exactly when. So, if she’s in the movie, a continuance would interfere with HER filming schedule.</p>
<p>We already know that she’s not in Aquaman 2, and she knows it, too. She’s pulling this out of her arse just to try to deny his request for a continuance. I mean, I can be TOLD that Aquaman is filming in the spring. That doesn’t mean I’ll be in it. Doesn’t mean she will, either. And for them not to tell her exactly when filming starts is a huge red flag. Johnny’s known for months ahead of time when FB3 was going to start filming. Certainly, if she was going to be in a blockbuster, she’d know when she was supposed to show up to film it so that she could arrange her schedule accordingly.</p>
<p>Heard went on to slam Adam Waldman, Johnny Depp’s lawyer, claiming that he’s done all sorts of things that are improper, maybe even illegal, based on social media posts that she doesn’t like.</p>
<p>I think my favorite line is when she says that she “intends to vindicate herself at trial.” Just like she did in London? Because that was just one big Charlie Foxtrot for her.</p>
<p>Every day that passes, she insists, provides further opportunity for Depp and Waldman to smear her good name, tarnish her reputation, and irreparably damage her career, which has long been Depp’s stated goal.</p>
<p>His STATED goal? When and where did he STATE that his goal is to irreparably damage her career? She needs to be careful with her wording. She’s already being sued for defamation. I don’t think it’s the best idea for her to defame him in ongoing court documents.</p>

<p>Don't forget, we've got it on good authority that WB bought out Heard's contract, sending her to the bench. Meaning that she got paid, but will not appear in Aquaman 2.</p>
<p>No, there hasn't been any official confirmation that she's out, and there likely won't be. The movie will simply come out without her in it. I wish there would be official word, but that's just not always the way it works, I'm sorry to say.</p>
<p>What other work will she be able to prove that Depp cost her through his false smear campaign to ruin her reputation on social media? Including the formation and manipulation of this very petition - according to her. What other movies did she have lined up that we bots have made her lose?</p>
<p>Word has it that she's unbondable. That means that she can't be insured during the production of a film. Without insurance, there's no part. Period. So, if that's the case, how is Johnny responsible? How are we?</p>

<p>The reason for the postponement is that Fantastic Beasts 3 is going to be filming from October this year until February of next year. So Johnny has asked for a postponement until May or June of 2021. </p>
<p>A hearing on the filing will take place Sept. 11.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a verdict on Depp’s libel suit against Rupert Murdoch’s U.K. tabloid The Sun is expected this week.</p>
<p>I have no doubt that Heard stans will be screaming that Johnny wants a postponement because he's running scared, or that he's putting other matters before legal matters, but neither could be further from the truth. </p>
<p>The truth is that Johnny isn't in charge of the filming schedule for FB3. He can't ask for dozens (hundreds?) of cast and crew to sit around and wait for him to appear in court. Filming really can't be delayed. The trial can. </p>

<p>If you tell your phone to Google Aquaman 2 and then choose to look at the cast, you'll notice that Amber Heard is conspicuously missing from the photo lineup.</p>
<p>Sadly, she's still listed on the movie's <a href=""https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9663764/"" rel=""nofollow"">IMDB</a>, and the movie is still listed on Heard's <a href=""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1720028/"" rel=""nofollow"">IMDB</a>, but hey. It's happening. Baby steps.</p>

<p>Besides, if she WERE in it, she'd be yapping her head off about it, just to shut up all us ""haters"" - I'm sure. But she hasn't said a single word. Instead, she's been too busy showing off her nipples in Turkish places of worship. So, doesn't that speak volumes?</p>

<p>During the DCFanDome panel, Aquaman 2 director James Wan discussed how the second film would expand upon the world of Jason Momoa's Aquaman. The director also stated that he was excited to continue the journeys of their heroes and expand their world in the second chapter.</p>
<p>Actor Patrick Wilson, who played King Orm, also discussed what he wanted from Aquaman 2 during the panel at DCFanDome. Patrick Wilson mentioned that he wanted the second movie to explore more of the ocean and explore “some new worlds”.</p>
<p>neither James Wan nor Patrick Wilson spoke about Heard's role in the sequel. The director and actor noticeably avoided talking about Amber Heard and the current controversy surrounding her. For those unaware, many fans want Amber Heard removed from Aquaman 2 due to her ongoing legal battle with Johnny Depp. </p>
<p>In fact, fans even started a petition online asking for Amber Heard's removal from the movie. As of now, WB and the makers of Aquaman 2 have not yet commented on Amber Heard's role in the movie. Aquaman 2 is set to release sometime in December of 2022. </p>
<p>Throughout the panel discussion, clips of the first Aquaman showed, including behind the scenes content about the making of the movie. But not once did they show a single image of Amber Heard. </p>
<p>That leaves conspicuously unanswered the question of whether Amber Heard will return as Mera in AM2. We have heard from reputable sources, however, that WB bought out Heard's contract, quietly giving her the boot from the franchise. By all accounts, Amber Heard will not be returning for AM2. </p>
<p>Will they write Mera out? A<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u77M-oANRtQ"" rel=""nofollow""> teaser</a> for the Snyder Cut of Justice League shows Aquaman bowing out on Mera, like ""See ya"" - hinting perhaps that her exit will be predicted there. </p>

<p>Remember when she called us all bots? Well, apparently she’s holding that position, while saying that not only are we bots, but that we’re bots on a Russian payroll.</p>
<p>She says: ""These accounts exhibit behavior which includes but is not limited to tweet to retweet ratios in numbers implausible for authentic human users; they are created, attack Ms. Heard, then are set to inactive to avoid suspension; they utilize common language, patterns, and timing indicating broad coordination; they often offer little or no personal information, suggesting computer-control or a single individual controlling more than one account at a time (and often many more); and they republicize the content of one another at rates and consistencies that bely authentic human control.""</p>
<p>Well, no kidding. They exhibit common language, timing and patterns because they’re all talking about the same topic, the TRUTH that Amber Heard abused Johnny Depp. There’s no collusion behind that. It’s the simple truth.</p>
<p>And as far as offering little to no personal information, it must REALLY bug her that she can’t find out who a few of you are. Good. Let her wonder who in the industry isn’t a bot and knows the truth about her that they aren’t shy to share.</p>
<p>She goes on to say: ""These accounts are designed to damage Ms. Heard and her livelihood without being directly traceable to Mr. Depp. For example, it appears that a significant number of the accounts signing the petition to remove Ms. Heard from the Aquaman franchise are conspicuously fake or highly suspicious. The use of fake signatures on these petitions is well outside the skill set of the average internet troll or disgruntled fan. They reflect a concerted effort to damage Ms. Heard. In addition, the change.org petitions were modified to make it appear that far more people signed the petitions than actually did.""</p>
<p>She says: ""There are a number of newly created foreign language accounts specifically or predominantly designed to damage Ms. Heard. Many of these accounts have Cyrillic signatures, reflecting Russian origin. Mr. Waldman, Mr. Depp’s agent and attorney, is publicly associated with Russian individuals with the capability to organize such attacks.""</p>

Likewise, modest clothing should be worn at holy places. Heard wore what she calls a head scarf, but has half her hair hanging out. She also shows her neck and cleavage. To top it off, she’s braless in a sheer dress that clearly shows her nipples.</p>
<p>She got called out on it from netizens, most of whom found it to be extremely disrespectful for her to appear this way in a place of worship. Muslim commenters found her actions to be unforgivable.</p>
<p>Amber Heard has struck back. She writes: 'Nope. Apparently whoever paid 4 this to b “written” wasnt paid enough. 'Ill make it easy(ier): Mosques are real places. So are museums &amp; churches. So are head scarfs (where they are sometimes required n order 2 visit). Mystery solved.'</p>
<p>First, she calls out the reporter for how the article is “written” then goes on to babble incoherently herself in gibberish that’s barely legible. She has little room to talk.</p>
<p>Second, the plural of scarf is scarves. Scarfs is loose slang for when one eats rapidly. And, more importantly, it’s not a simple head scarf. It’s a hijab, which when worn properly has social and religious meaning. She is obviously clueless not just about what it’s called, but what it represents.</p>
<p>Further, yes. Mosques are real places. They are places of worship which should be treated with respect. That respect does, indeed, require “head scarfs” to be worn, not just as fashion accessories for photo ops, but to be worn properly to show the place and the people the respect they deserve. By refusing to do that, she shows a staggering level of disrespect.</p>
<p>Her dress is likewise abysmally disrespectful, with her nipples clearly showing through. She was wearing a jacket which she could easily have pulled closed around her chest for modesty. But it’s clear that she has none. And there’s nothing wrong with that bohemian attitude on the streets of Soho, perhaps. But in a place of worship where people were praying, a place where modesty is expected, it goes down like a lead balloon.</p>
<p>It’s clear that her trip to the mosque was nothing more than a photo op. And when she got called on it, she’s completely without remorse. She lashes out like a child at the people that criticized her. She had a chance to learn something and be humble, even apologize, but instead chose to show her true colors. Vindictive and childish.</p>
<p>I, for one, just can’t wait for the judgement to come down in London, the first nail in her career coffin. Then for the judgement against her in Virginia, which will be the finish of her. Not that she really needs those judgments to finish her off. Word has it that not only is she removed from Aquaman 2, but that she’s also blacklisted. Nobody wants to work with her. And I don’t blame them. She comes across as a spoiled, selfish, abusive brat. Who wants to work with that?</p>
<p>More as it happens, my dears.</p>

The amazing @ThatBrianFella - Incredibly Average on YouTube, has posted it for us. Thanks, dude.</p>
<p>In the TMZ version, it's a low-quality video that ends when Johnny snatches up the phone and the screen goes blank. Amber Heard supporters claim that that's when he started to smack her around.</p>
<p>But this version extends beyond that, both at the beginning and the end. In the beginning, it shows Amber Heard turning on the phone to record, and setting it up where he couldn't see it.</p>
<p>The interesting stuff happens at the end, though. After Johnny snatches up the phone and throws it in the trash, he says ""Bye."" and leaves the room. No slapping her around, nothing of the sort. He leaves.</p>
<p>From there, the video shows Amber fishing the phone out of the trash, gigging and smirking, like she knows she just got one over on him. She then follows Johnny before turning the phone off. Hardly the picture of the poor, embattled victim she wanted the world to think she was.</p>
<p>What I love is that the defense showed the TMZ version of the video repeatedly in London, to try to prove what a monster he is. Then, on the closing day, BOOM! David Sherborne showed the whole video, blowing that pretext clean out of the water. Just like a rock and roll pirate. I only wish I could have seen the look on Heard's face. </p>

More about that soon.</p>
<p>But I thought I’d share this little tidbit with you. It shows that Whitney has the same garbage attitude as her sister, with a mouth to match.</p>
<p>I’m not sure when this is from, but on Twitter, Christina18angie @242sx had the guts to stand up and ask someone who followed Whitney the hard question, saying: “My god! How can you follow a person who helped try to destroy Johnny? This woman and Amber are bad!”</p>

<p>Whitney’s a grown woman with the world at her feet. She’s got a husband and son at home, yet she chooses to traipse around the world with her sister, perjuring herself to try and clean up her sister’s mess. Shows where her priorities lie.</p>

Johnny Depp is suing the Sun tabloid for calling him a wife-beater, remember. And Amber's team brought it up. Johnny was forced to answer about it. </p>
<p>I didn't realize that Johnny or Amber were even aware of our little petition until then. </p>
<p>I keep seeing articles repeating the same notion, that Johnny Depp colluded with me to start this thing. <a href=""https://blindgossip.com/throw-another-log-on-this-legal-fire/"" rel=""nofollow"">Another one</a> came out just the other day. I still think it's hysterical, but the ore I see it, the more I wonder. Am I going to have to testify that I alone started this thing? The more she pushes, the more I think I might actually have to.</p>
<p>Not that I mind at all. I started this thing for a specific reason, and I still have a clear conscience about it. I do not believe that a serial abuser should be celebrated in the entertainment industry. I said it on the front page and I still believe it. If I'm called to the stand, that's exactly what I'll say. </p>
<p>And if they ask me why I write under the name Jeannie Depp, I'll tell them. It has more to do with me than him. (I simply didn't want my ex to see his name on my work anymore, so I chose another name to use, one that I hoped would best serve my work.)</p>
<p>If they want to twist that into something ugly, I can't stop them. All I can do is tell the truth. Unlike the defendant, I haven't done anything that I should be ashamed of.</p>

Especially considering the amount of time the movie will need in post to make it look like all those people are underwater. </p>
<p>So, will Amber be among the cast? Some sources say that WB bought out Amber's contract so that she got paid but won't be in it. (which I believe.) Others say that she's set to reprise her role as Mera. </p>
<p>There's another thing to consider. Filming will take place in Australia. And if Barnaby Joyce has his way, there might be perjury charges over Pistol and Boo waiting for her there if she returns. </p>
<p>And there's no statute of limitations in Australia for crimes that involve grievous bodily injury, so she can still face charges over what happened to Johnny's finger. </p>

There are strict laws about bringing animals into Australia without a quarantine period, and Heard volated them when she brought the dogs into the country on the couple’s private jet. She got out of jail time by agreeing to make a public service announcement about how important the country’s bio-laws are. You can see the cringe-worthy video HERE.</p>
<p>Now, Barnaby Joyce is demanding that Amber Heard be probed for perjury after allegedly telling an assistant to lie about bringing her two dogs illegally into Australia at the time. <br>Depp's former assistant of eight years, Kevin Murphy, said Heard made him lie under oath when they were accused of bringing in the dogs illegally. Mr Murphy claimed Heard told him: 'I want your help on this. I wouldn't want you to have a problem with your job'. The assistant said he had told the actress several times over the phone, email and in person she was unable to bring the dogs. <br>Paperwork and the required ten day quarantine period had not been arranged for Pistol and Boo.</p>
<p>Barnaby Joyce is calling the whole thing Dodgy ', saying that Depp and Heard were “just treating the whole thing as a joke. They had no regard for the law as they had no regard for biosecurity laws,' Mr Joyce said. And now he wants Amber Heard to pay for it. He’s got no love lost for Johnny Depp, but it was Amber Heard that smuggled the dogs.</p>
<p>“The Department of Agriculture, Water and the Environment is aware of recent media reports concerning the prosecution of Ms Amber Heard in Australia in 2016 and is consulting with the CDPP (Commonwealth Department of Public Prosecution) on this issue,” a spokesperson told Strewth. After a bit of sniffing around, senior sources informed us an investigation was potentially on the cards. The maximum penalty for perjury in Queensland? Fourteen years in jail.</p>
<p>14 years. That’s nothing to play with.</p>
<p>What do you think? Will Amber Heard be tried and convicted in Australia on top of her legal woes with Johnny Depp? Me, I hope so. I hope so a lot.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>Barnaby Joyce was Agricultural Minister of Australia when Amber Heard was charged with smuggling Pistol and Boo into the country in October, 2015. He told the dogs to buggar off back to America and threatened to euthanize them.</p>
<p>Well, Barny obviously hasn’t forgotten about Johnny Depp or Amber Heard. He told 60 minutes Australia: “Hey, Johnny, look where your life ended up, old trout! They might be royalty in Hollywood, but we don’t give a toss about that.”</p>
<p>From the beginning, the Aussie documentary seemed heavily slanted toward Amber Heard’s version of events, showing pictures of Johnny sleeping on the floor and sleeping on the couc”h covered in her ice cream, her incessant blathering about how he beat her up and pulled out clumps of her hair.</p>
<p>I watched, waiting for the show to give Johnny equal time, but it didn’t really happen. While the show didn’t try to predict the outcome of Johnny’s libel trial against the Sun, they did say with certainty that everybody involved walks away “stained.”</p>
<p>Me, I disagree. Throughout the course of the trial, with all the evidence being made public every day, there has been an increasing outpouring of support for Johnny Depp, while Amber Heard’s public opinion took a heavy nose dive. People waited outside to give Johnny flowers, while all Amber got was boos. I think Johnny will walk away vindicated, win or lose. The world knows what she did to him, now, and there’s no going back from that.</p>
<p>I’ll give the show some credit, though. While they played Amber’s whining about being abused, they did show pictures of Johnny’s actual injuries, albeit fleetingly, and playing the tape where Amber admits to hitting Johnny repeatedly.</p>
<p>They made repeated use out of that TMZ video, where Johnny was kicking cabinets, as that’s just about the only “evidence” Amber’s team could present that he was ever violent. And I was less than thrilled when it was thrown out there that Johnny might have shat in his own bed and said that he was self-immolating by bringing the libel proceedings.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the show insinuated that both Johnny and Amber are guilty, and that they’re both damaged, no matter who wins.</p>
<p>What the show seems to forget is that this case isn’t between Johnny and Amber. THIS case is between Johnny Depp and the Sun tabloid. Amber was just a witness. So there’s no way that Amber Heard can win, here. I’m sure she’d claim victory for herself if the Sun prevails, but such really is not the case. Despite her narcissistic need for attention, not everything is about her.</p>
<p>I’ll be honest, I didn’t finish watching the show. With about 10 minutes left, I decided that I’d seen enough of the both-blaming game they were playing.</p>

In her statement, she said that after her divorce, she just wanted to move on with her life, and that reliving her marriage’s breakup was “incredibly painful.”</p>
<p>I cry BS. If she just wanted to move on with her life, she wouldn’t have made all those comments about being the victim of domestic violence, which we now know is completely untrue. She wouldn’t have written that WaMo op-ed that got her sued in the first place.</p>
<p>She also said that she would have preferred not to be here in court. Again, I say rubbish. She didn’t have to be there all day every day. She only needed to appear to testify. That was two or three days out of three weeks, but she insisted upon showing up every day.</p>

StarterPetitionUpdate,27399739,2020-07-28T13:45:48.000Z,,dc-entertainment-remove-amber-heard-from-aquaman-2,Team Depp's closing arguments,"<p>Here it is, folks, the final day of court. Amber arrived back in her school marm mode, all black from head to toe. She couldn’t resist trying to sex it up a bit though, with a sky-high slit up the front of her skirt. Johnny’s in a grey suit, looking in good spirits ahead of closing arguments on his behalf. Fans had flowers and artwork and chanted “Justice for Johnny!” in support for him. He, in turn, handed out thank you notes and bandanas to the crowd as a thank you for their support throughout this entire ordeal. What a sweetheart.</p>
<p>David Sherborne spoke out on behalf of Johnny today, starting with a much-needed reminder not to lose focus on why we’re all here. It’s not this Depp v Heard drama; that will be settled in Virginia in early 2021. What we’re here for is to decide whether or not the Sun tabloid libeled Johnny Depp when they called him a “wife-beater” on the front cover and continued to portray him as such in the article. That’s it. Everything else is smoke and mirrors.</p>
<p>The burden of proof, Sherborne said, falls to the Sun to prove that the article was true. And frankly, everything they’ve tried to pull throughout the course of this trial just doesn’t fly. Every accusation of violence save one depends solely upon the fact that Amber Heard says so. They didn’t put forth a shred of evidence that wasn’t easily debunked.</p>
<p>The one accusation of violence is the “stairs” incident, at which Heard’s sister Whitney was supposedly present. And Whitney is obviously biased. Whether through loyalty to her sister or fear of retaliation, Whitney supported Heard’s version of events, even though that was easily debunked, too. Heard’s own medical history proves that she was never injured. All those doctors and nurses aren’t lying.</p>
<p>Heard was the abuser in the relationship, Sherborne points out. And Johnny’s not only got physical and medical evidence to support that, he’s got a myriad of witnesses who saw her being violent toward him. And, to top it all off, he’s got Heard on tape confessing to it. That’s pretty cut and dried.</p>
<p>Over and over throughout the course of the trial, Heard has gotten caught in one lie after the next. She lied about the dogs in Australia, she lied to Homeland security, and she’s lied about every single incident where she claims Johnny Depp abused her. Each and every lie was categorically debunked and exposed. That completely shatters any credibility she had going in, which wasn’t much to begin with.</p>
<p>Now it goes to the judge, and there’s no telling how long he’ll take to reach a decision. It could be tomorrow, or it could take weeks. Given the complexity and sheer volume of testimony and evidence there is to consider, I think it’ll take some time. But when the decision finally comes down, I’ll be sure to post it just as fast as I can.</p>","{'id': '224356263', 'petitionMedium': {'url': '//assets.change.org/photos/5/re/om/VYREomPtMrNIzNp-800x450-noPad.jpg?1595943950', 'processing': False}}",,,,against

Amber Heard was front and center, wearing a skin-tight white dress that really did her no favors.</p>
<p>Counsel for NGN basically rehashed everything that Team Amber spewed forth throughout the trial, that Johnny Depp is a monster, out of control on drink and drugs, potentially unaware of just how bad he really is. Depp really is the wife-beating monster Amber Heard made him out to be, they say. And, according to NGN, Depp is the deflector, accusing Heard of every terrible thing HE did, not the other way around.</p>
<p>That seemed to be their biggest tactic, deflecting all of Heard’s bad deeds back onto him. Aside from painting her as the poor little damsel in distress, that is. Another favorite fallback for them seems to be saying that poor little Amber was too tiny to have inflicted so much damage onto Johnny. She only weighed 115, they say. She COULDN’T have done it, they say.</p>
<p>Bullshit, I say.</p>
<p>A tiny woman is capable of throwing a haymaker. And that particular woman is capable of a lot more than that. There’s the hurling of heavy projectiles, one of which smashed off part of his guitar-playing finger. And let’s not forget putting a cigarette out on his face and defecating in his bed.</p>
<p>No, folks. Height and weight isn’t necessarily a factor to how much damage a woman can do. Especially when you have a man that didn’t fight back. This defense is rubbish, of course.</p>

StarterPetitionUpdate,27370986,2020-07-24T16:02:11.000Z,,dc-entertainment-remove-amber-heard-from-aquaman-2,Rocky and iO testify,"<p>Mic Drop Testimony and Evidence</p>
<p>Team Depp hit the ground running today. Of major interest, David Sherborne introduced evidence that proved that Whitney was lying when she testified that she did not know her sister to be violent. It’s a transcript of  a recording - given to his team last night - which shows that Ms Henriquez does have knowledge of Heard being violent. So, Boom. Whitney’s testimony is tainted. <br>Earlier in the week, Amber said that she rarely (Never?) goes outside without makeup, but testimony was given today by Amber’s acting coach Kristina Sexton that she rarely wore makeup in the daytime, if ever. And that when she did, it was light. Describing Heard's routine, Ms Sexton says: ""She wore very little. Just foundation, or lip or cheek tint if it was daytime... If it was an evening event, someone would do her make-up for her."" So, again. Boom.<br>I have a feeling we’re going to see a lot of those today.  <br>Sexton also shredded other of Amber’s testimony. For example, testifying that she never saw Johnny be violent, but only repeats what Amber said because she has no reason to lie to her. Bitch, please. Amber’s nothing BUT a lie. <br>Ms Laws says that Heard told Ms Sexton: ""Johnny will never let me go, he would rather destroy me than let me go"". Ms Laws asks Ms Sexton if she's aware that while Heard was telling her about the alleged domestic abuse, Heard was also contacting Depp and telling him he could stop the whole divorce process if he wanted. <br>Ms Sexton says she was not aware of this. <br>Ms. Sexton reported that Amber was worried about bad publicity over her split with Depp, because, sure. That’s what any normal woman would be thinking. Of course not. Any survivor of such horrid domestic abuse that she said she suffered at his hands would be relieved to be out of the line of fire.</p>
<p>Johnny arrived a half-hour late this morning, perhaps due to more meetings about an upcoming role.</p>
<p>Continuing with Ms. Sexton, she says that on the night of Amber’s 30th birthday party, she was told that Johnny was upstairs, refusing to come down, going so far as to say that Amber and Whitney said they went upstairs to try and get him to come down. Remember, that’s the night that Johnny was late to the party because of a business meeting. He wasn’t upstairs at all. <br>Ms. Sexton is supposed to be Heard’s witness, and does support some aspects of Heard’s story. But, by being honest about things like makeup-gate, she does a fine job of impugning the integrity of Heard’s testimony. <br>The video discussed earlier is finally shown. In it, a woman is talking to Whitney and examining several injuries, saying: “I can’t believe Amber beat you up.”  <br>Yep. That’s BOOM. Proof that Whitney had knowledge of Amber being violent, and being a victim of that violence herself. Busted. <br>Ms. Wass complains that this evidence, which was submitted only last night, is “an ambush” and asks for it to be excluded. But the judge allows the video. <br>Whitney is recalled to the stand. She insists that there was no physical fight between the sisters. It was just the producers trying to make the show more interesting. There are no bruises, she says. The lawyers are looking for injuries that aren’t there. Even though they’re clearly visible. She is so busted it hurts.</p>
<p>After lunch, Whitney was back in the hot seat, spewing out the same story that Johnny was violent when he wasn’t sober. And with that, she was done.</p>
<p>The next witness was Raquel (Rocky) Pennington, who confirmed that she lived rent-free in one of Johnny’s penthouses for roughly two years. Can you imagine? Living RENT FREE in an LA penthouse? And then turning around and betraying the guy that paid for it? I can’t. <br>Rocky did confirm that she’s never seen Johnny beat Amber, but insisted that she saw “deep” gashes on Amber’s arms after Australia and believed Ambers explanation that Johnny did it. She also said that she personally saw all those cuts on Amber’s feet. Ms. Wass suggested that this was a lie, because no cuts existed, but Rocky insists that such was not the case. She says she’s not lying for her friend Amber. <br>Except for insisting that she saw Amber’s cut feet, Rocky’s testimony seems to be toeing the line, saying that all the accounts of Johnny being violent are hearsay, what Amber told her. Not from anything that she witnessed. That actually goes to Johnny’s favor. In fact, throughout her testimony, Rocky seemed a bit wishy-washy, supporting Amber, but leaving a lot of grey area for interpretation. For example, Rocky says that she was best friends with Amber in 2014-2016, but that they aren’t best friends anymore. Just that they “remain close.” That could mean a whole lot, either way. Maybe she was trying to distance herself from Amber so it wouldn’t look like she’d lie for her, or maybe there’s a little bit of trouble in paradise. Like I said, it’s open to interpretation. <br>In the end, Rocky ended up backing Amber, confirming injuries that never happened, like the broken nose and bloody lip Amber says she had before the James Cordon show. When shown photos from the show, Rocky admits that there aren’t any visible injuries, but that her “eyes aren’t that good.” <br>Pitiful. <br>Rocky did trip Amber up a little bit, though, by testifying that Amber was so intoxicated at Coachella that she vomited. Amber earlier testified that she did not vomit at the festival. Woops.</p>
<p>And, like Ms. Sexton, Rocky didn’t know that Amber was in contact with Johnny trying to get him back. So it looks like Amber was doing some shady things behind her buddies’ backs, while getting them to set the stage for her to frame up Johnny. <br>Rocky contradicted herself when Ms. Wass redirected. She backpedaled about Coachella, saying that she did not see Amber Vomit. Too little too late. The damage is done.</p>
<p>Up next, iO Tillet-wright. We’ll find out what he did or didn’t know, whether he backs Heard blindly, or if he’s the first to cut and run. <br>Ms Laws, lawyer for Johnny Depp, will be the first to question iO. First up, iO was asked about outing Lily-Rose Depp and using her photo in his project at the time, even though she was only 16 at the time. iO confirms that Johnny wasn’t happy about it. They had a falling out over it and weren’t speaking at the time. But just like everybody else, iO never saw Johnny being violent toward Amber. He only knows what Amber Heard told him. <br>Ms Laws asked about iO slapping Rocky, but the judge put a stop to that. Pity.<br>Ms. Laws ends her questioning after establishing that iO and Rocky competed for Amber’s attention. iO called that an over-simplification, but didn’t dispute it.</p>
<p>Ms Wass began by asking iO about poopgate, and iO said that Amber couldn’t possibly be responsible for it because she’s poop-phobic and pretends that she doesn’t even poop in private, let alone in somebody’s bed. <br>Wait. Pretends she doesn’t poop? Sure, because that’s SO normal. <br>iO’s account of the Phone-throwing fight is pretty useless, as he was in New York at the time and only heard what Amber wanted him to hear over the phone. All he could really testify to is that he called 911.  It’s interesting that iO said the following: “A number of people who worked in the entertainment industry were afraid of speaking up and saying what they had seen as they feared they would be blacklisted."" Because I firmly believe this to be true, except that I don’t think it’s Johnny they were afraid of. Amber has reportedly left a swath of damage in her path of people afraid to speak up against her for fear of blackmail or other retaliation. So I do believe iO snuck the truth in there at the end. Just not overtly.<br>That’s the end of iO’s testimony, and that’s the end of testimony in this case. On Monday, the Sun will submit their closing statement. On Tuesday, Team Johnny will give their closing statement.</p>
<p>Amber’s team are undoubtedly claiming victory after her buddies testified, but I still think that the case is leaning heavily in Johnny’s favor. I don’t think anything said today really helped Amber at all. If anything, it shot her in the food. That’s my humble opinion, anyway. What do you think?<br><br><a href=""https://news.sky.com/story/johnny-depp-libel-trial-amber-heards-sister-to-finish-giving-evidence-12035106"" rel=""nofollow"">SOURCE</a></p>","{'id': '224336053', 'petitionMedium': {'url': '//assets.change.org/photos/8/uz/hc/vPuZHcYjtooQvge-800x450-noPad.jpg?1595606532', 'processing': False}}",,,,against
StarterPetitionUpdate,27361763,2020-07-23T14:34:59.000Z,,dc-entertainment-remove-amber-heard-from-aquaman-2,"Amber's last day, sister Whitney's first","<p>Sasha Wass is opening questioning, telling Amber Heard we will be starting off with 'the painting incident' which took place in March 2013. We will also be looking at Heard's sixth witness statement, given on 6 July 2020.<br>Amber is wearing black this morning, and her hair is braided at the root, but wavy and loose around her shoulders. She is sipping from a water bottle as she flicks through a large black file of evidence, which in court is referred to as the ""trial bundle.”</p>
<p>We will be hearing about the painting incident which is alleged to have taken place at one of Depp's many homes, in Sweetzer Avenue which is in West Hollywood.</p>
<p>Heard explains to the judge that Depp owns several houses at the end of this road. <br>The painting incident was initially said to have occurred on 8 March 2013, after which there was some filming with Rolling Stone Keith Richards. However, in Heard's sixth statement, Heard wrote:  ""I have now realized I cannot be sure that the painting incident took place on 8 March 2013.” Heard tells the court she now believes the painting incident actually occurred on 22 March 2013. Heard says there were around three times there was filming with Keith Richards over that month. <br>Depp's lawyer Eleanor Laws QC interrupts at this point, saying this is a very important part of the evidence, and she requests permission from the judge to ask Heard questions about it too. <br>Depp is yet to arrive in court this morning. His lawyer has told us this is because he's in a ""film meeting,” so will be a little late. We are expecting him around midday. This means it's possible he may miss Heard's last morning giving evidence. Depp has been later in court a few times this week, which was also said to be due to ""film meetings.”</p>
<p>We are now looking at a text exchange between Heard and Depp's assistant Nathan Holmes on 22 March 2013. It begins around noon with Holmes writing: ""On my way to get him.” To which Heard replies: ""Trying to wake him now.” <br>Holmes replies: ""OK. Thank you.” <br>We then fast forward around six hours, and Heard says she has had ""success"" and has got Depp up. <br>Ms. Wass asks what was happening in those six hours. <br>Heard says he was ""snorting cocaine and drinking whisky.” She says they were talking about the relationship and Depp was jealous, believing she was having affairs with several people including her ex-wife, artist Tasya van Ree. <br>Heard says Depp wouldn't leave the subject alone. Heard describes Depp as being on ""a bender"" at this stage. She says she reached out to friends and her mother at the time. <br>There is another text exchange between Mr. Holmes and Heard in which Heard asks: ""Is he alright? Still upright?” <br>Mr. Holmes answers: ""Yes, OK. He's still upright."" <br>Heard says she asked this as Depp had been taking cocaine and drinking for around 36 hours, and at that point she wasn't used to ""his patterns,” so was worried about his health. She says she wanted to check he was ""still alive.”</p>
<p>We look at a text exchange between Heard and her mother Paige Parsons who died in May of this year. Heard's text to her mum says: ""Dealing with Johnny's spiral. It's terrible mom. I don't know what to do"" and goes on to say ""He's nuts mom. Violent and crazy. I am heartbroken that THIS is who I love.” Her mother says she should tell her father, David. <br>But Heard texts back to say ""I can't tell Dad.” Heard says she trusted her mother, but didn't know whether her ""dad would react violently.” Heard clarifies she means violently towards Depp. <br>A later text to her mother says: ""My heart is broken. I'm OK physically. JD didn't hit me or anything last night. I told him that would be it if he did and it worked last night. But I'm scared by what I see and who I see now. It's Dr Jekyll and Mr. Hyde -- on a binge. He's not violent to me"" (talking about Depp). <br>Heard tells Ms. Wass she sent this text to her mother as she had sent pictures of her of her bruises pictures to her mother, but didn't want her father to react badly. <br>Heard also sent another text in which she says there was no physical abuse, writing: ""It's OK Mom. He's not being violent with me. He's just even raging in general. And the crazy mood swings and binges are really difficult for me to handle."" She tells Ms. Wass she knew about that first hand as: ""My father was like this to my mother growing up.” Heard sounds emotional as she explains to Ms. Wass what she meant by a text she sent to her mother saying: ""I feel like I'm on a very fast train that's about to explode but I don't want to jump off and leave my love behind . So I stay on the train, even though I know it's about to explode.""<br>She goes on to describe what she says are two distinct parts to Depp's personality. She says when he was sober, he was: ""Generous, loving, a remarkable man when he's like that... The other side of him is a monster. I always held out hope he would get clean and sober.” <br>Heard again clarifies that in texts where she told her mother Depp didn't hit her, she was simply trying to stop her father from finding out about the alleged domestic violence. <br>Heard describes her father David to the court, saying: ""He's an addict and an alcoholic, and very violent, but I loved him very much.” <br>In a text to her mother, referring to Depp, Heard says: ""He makes dad look like a saint when he falls off the wagon.” <br>Heard says over this period Depp had stayed at her house for weeks. She says: ""I couldn't get a moments sleep, I was either defending myself or trying to keep him happy... I don't know how it got so violent so fast."" <br>Heard says at one point, she was so exhausted she ""accidentally on purpose"" locked the dead-bolts to keep Depp out of her house, and says she had the best night's sleep she'd had in ages. She texted her mother to say she'd done this. <br>Heard's mother replies: ""Oh my baby, has he stayed this way since then?.” Her mum then asks what Depp's bodyguards are doing about it all.</p>
<p>We are now talking about Heard's sister Whitney Henriquez. In Whitney's first statement, she says Heard told her Depp had ""defaced"" Tasya van Ree's painting, altering the signature to make it read ""Tasya van Pee.” Ms. Laws is saying this is a ""detail to add into their [Heard and Whitney's] constructed account,” and that Depp's act was actually a ""lighthearted joke"" between all-three, then used as evidence in a bid to show Depp in a bad light.<br>There is now some faff in court as everyone searches for a picture. Possibly of some flamingos. No one seeMs. quite sure. <br>Okay, there is a painting of some flamingos, but it's not the one we're talking about. <br>The court is looking at a picture, which is said to include some bags and squares (unfortunately I can't see it to be more specific), and which Heard says was damaged by Depp. Heard says after it was damaged, it was put in the garage. <br>Ms. Laws says talking about this painting has reminded her that ""Mr. Depp was not asked about this painting at all.” She is not very happy about this, and says this topic has come up after Depp's stint in the witness box. Earlier this week Heard said Depp had damaged many paintings during their relationship, hence this slight confusion over exactly which art-work we're talking about.<br>Ms. Wass asks: ""Are any of these paintings the one that Mr. Depp asked you to remove from your bedroom.” <br>Heard answers: ""Yes, it's the one there, that's now sitting in my garage.” <br>The judge is asking for clarification as to which painting she means. <br>""It's the one with flamingos, and it's always been that one,” Heard answers. <br>Ms. Wass asks ""What damage, if any, was there to the painting?"" However, before Heard can answer there is some debate between Ms. Laws and Ms. Wass over whether this question is leading the witness. <br>The judge eventually rules Heard can answer. <br>Heard says: ""This is the painting he tried to burn. He tried to burn it when I objected to taking it down.” Heard says the picture is damaged on the back from this attempted burning.</p>
<p>Now we are moving on to the ""three-day hostage situation"" which is alleged to have taken place in March 2015. First, Ms. Wass asks Heard if she knew about texts between Depp and his assistant Mr. Holmes, dubbed the ""drug texts.” These got Depp into hot water ahead of the trial, when the judge found he was in breach of court for not disclosing the texts to The Sun's lawyers. <br>Heard says she had not been previously aware of these texts.<br>We are looking at texts describing the alleged damage to the house the couple were renting in Australia at the time of the alleged incident. Alleged damage includes broken glass, graffiti on mirrors and broken surfaces. <br>Ms. Wass asks Heard if she was responsible for any of the damage. <br>Heard replies: ""I broke a bottle, that is all.”<br>We now hear a quote from Depp's late head of security, Jerry Judge, in which he says an artwork in the house had been defaced and a penis had been drawn on to a painting of a woman. <br>Ms. Wass reads out the extract from Mr. Judge's statement: ""There are two pictures here standing, very sexy. One in a bikini, standing with her hands on her breasts. What he did was paint a fake d*ck on her p****.” <br>Ms. Laws is objecting to this questioning, not just because it is rather ripe, but because she says the witness is being asked to describe not just what she saw, but also what others saw. <br>Ms. Wass says it shows the ""global destruction"" going on and the ""derangement of Mr. Depp's mind"" at the time, which she says Heard is being made out to have fabricated. <br>Ms. Wass re-frames the question, and we continue.</p>
<p>Heard now describes the scene she says she was met with on entering the house: ""There was mashed potato and gravy smeared on the door outside. <br>""There was  bird in the house. It scared me to death when entered room. It must have flown in window. There was blood everywhere. I thought it was from my feet but it wasn't. I thought it was paint, a kind of brownish color, on the walls. It was dark brown at first, then lightened out to a milky brown colour."" She says the writing which was ""all the way down the stairs and stairwell"" was letters, and she could make out some words written in English. She says there was ""blood on the walls, on lampshades and everywhere with written messages.” <br>She continues: ""He had burned though cushions and lampshades... There was a couch flipped over. It appeared he had set fire to one of the cushions because the couch was burned around it."" <br>Upstairs in the bedroom level Heard says: ""There was a broken window... My paints were out, it appears to be he had either thrown or dropped paint on the floor and on the wall. There was both paint and blood, I could see textures. <br>""I found raw meat, at first I didn't know what it was on the floor. I continued to find it for the next day hidden in various places. <br>""He had taken my nightgown and wrapped it around pieces of food. It was food I had got food out the night before, but not got round to  making it. <br>""I could see my own bloody footprints, and what appeared to be dripping blood. ""I made it downstairs and there was death metal blasting out. There was blood and glass everywhere, and the tiles floor was still wet. There were windows broken. There was so much glass I could barely find a path to walk. The ping pong table was broken and on the ground.""<br>Ms. Wass asks if Heard threw a bottle and damaged Depp's finger. Heard says no. She says: ""It occurred about 24-hours into his binge, his rage.” She says it was after ""he held me up against the fridge and said over and over again that he wished he had never met me and I'd ruined his life. he said I made him drink and I always did this."" She goes on: ""He held a bottle up to my face and said he'd cut me. At some point I pushed him, and tried to push his arMs. away."" <br>Heard tells the court Depp damaged his finger when he repeatedly punched the wall with a cream Bakelite phone, which she says smashed into many pieces. She says at the time she didn't realise that was when he cut his finger, but that is when she believes it happened. Heard describes Depp as being ""out of his mind"" at the time of the alleged incident.</p>
<p>The court took a short break.<br>Ms. Wass has been reminded by the judge that she must finish her questioning by lunch time, as Heard's sister Whitney is due to enter the witness box this afternoon.</p>
<p>Heard is standing in the witness box waiting to resume giving evidence. She has three bottles of water next to her and is putting some sanitizing gel on her hands.</p>
<p>We are talking about an alleged domestic violence incident, when Heard says Depp pulled her by the hair and punched her in the face in March 2015. <br>At this time Heard's sister, Whitney, was also said to be there at the time. This was referred to in court yesterday as the ""staircase incident.” <br>Depp was wearing a hard plaster cast on his hand at the time, following the incident in Australia. Heard later returned to Australia with Depp the following month, and to the same house, after the March 2015 incident. <br>Ms. Heard begins to answer: ""I lived in many houses, and I was assaulted many times."" <br>Ms. Wass asks why she returned to the house in Australia. <br>Heard answers: ""I was used to that.”</p>
<p>We now look at a text from the late Jerry Judge on 26 April 2015. <br>This was five days after Heard and Depp's return to Australia (with their dogs Pistol and Boo).<br>""Hi boss... It's lovely to see how you and Amber are so happy. Seeing you sitting on that bench together yesterday... You two need happiness.” Heard says Depp wasn't drinking or taking drugs at the time.<br>We are talking about the couple's return to Australia to complete Depp's filming of Pirates Of The Caribbean. This was the occasion when the dogs were illegally ""smuggled"" into the country, creating a bio hazard threat. <br>However, at this point it seeMs. the judge has heard enough about the dogs, and says he has already listened to plenty of evidence on this.</p>
<p>We move on to more specific questioning about the forMs. that were filled out ahead of the dogs entering the country. At the time, Heard pleaded guilty to illegally bringing them into the country, despite saying she was not responsible for filling out the forMs. and had believed the dogs had had the correct shots to travel.</p>
<p>We will now see a transcript of a recording, which Ms. Wass says was captured on 26 September 2015. The couple had a practice of recording arguments early on in their relationship, in an attempt to learn from them and come to a constructive conclusion. Later in the relationship covert recordings of arguments were also captured. Both types of recording are being heard as evidence in the case. The recording took place after the couple's honeymoon trip to South East Asia, which was in July 2015. In the conversation, Depp talks about their honeymoon, saying it was good apart from one argument in San Francisco. <br>He also talks about their arguments and says: ""There can be no physical violence towards each other.” He says when they fall out, they need to physically separate from each other in order to cool off and avoid conflict. He goes on to say otherwise we will ""f***ing kill each other, or worse you know, f***ing break up.” <br>Depp's lawyer, Ms. Laws, is again saying there is an issue here - that these questions have not been put to Depp so ""there is no evidential basis"" for the questions to Heard. The judge upholds this, and we move on.</p>
<p>We return to the days leading up to Heard's appearance on the James Corden Late Late show on 16 December 2015. <br>Ms. Wass is reminding us Heard has been accused of making the injuries up, and also of photo shopping images. <br>Heard says she did not. She also says she put no make-up on to make injuries appear worse, adding ""I put make up on only to try to hide them [the injuries].” <br>There were also images of a broken bed in penthouse 4 supplied. Heard says yes, and she did not damage the bed. <br>Images of clumps of hair were also pictured on the floor. <br>Head says she did not pull out her own hair, and nor did she ask anyone else to pull out her hair. <br>During the fight on 12 December, Heard also alleges that Depp headbutted her. <br>We are talking about a recording of an argument between Depp and Heard that was taken around July 2016, which mentions a headbutt. In it you can hear Depp saying: ""I headbutted you... in the forehead. That doesn't break a nose.” <br>Ms. Wass asks Heard at what point she realised there was a recording in which Depp mentioned a headbutt, but the judge tells her to move on.</p>
<p>We move on to a visit from nurse, Erin Boerum to Heard on 17 December 2015.</p>
<p>Heard says: ""She was just dropping off meds, and she was late.”</p>
<p>We move on to Heard and Depp travelling to the Bahamas with his children in 2014. However, now again, Ms. Laws interrupts and we move on.</p>
<p>We watch a video, showing the inside of the house in the Bahamas. The person filming the video is walking towards a beaded curtain on a doorway, and the bathroom is apparently through the curtain and to the left. <br>Heard has alleged she was abused inside the closet, and from the inside of the bathroom, inside the door. <br>The video goes on to show the closet, and a bed, and pan around the room. We can hear no more on this subject, as we are now veering towards parts of the hearing that need to be held in private. <br>Parts of Heard's evidence, relating to allegations of sexual violence, have been heard in private, with the media excluded from the proceedings.</p>
<p>We move on to just after Heard's 30th birthday, and a photo that was taken on 23 April 2016. Heard says it was taken at the Coachella Festival. Heard names her friends in the picture left to right: Romi Serafy, herself, Whitney, Melanie Inglessis, iO Tillet Wright, and Savannah McMillan. <br>She nearly forgets her final friend's name, and laughs as she stumbles to find the name. <br>Ms. Wass puts it to Heard that she has been accused of ""painting on injuries"" that can be seen in photos now being shown to the court. This was alleged to be from photos taken during the last big alleged argument between Depp and Heard on 21 May 2016. The photo metadata shows it was taken at 8.23pm before the police arrived later that evening. <br>Heard says she neither put on make up to enhance nor create the appearance of injures, and says she also didn't want to talk to the police. <br>Ms. Wass says it was also suggested to Heard that her and her friends - including neighbor Rocky Pennington - trashed the penthouse and said it was Depp who had done it in order to frame him. <br>Heard says no, this is not the case.</p>
<p>We are now watching CCTV video taken in the LA penthouse apartment block, taken on 22 May 2016. It shows Heard entering the lift, while texting on her phone. She then gets out of the lift. <br>Heard returns to the lift a few minutes later holding packages. Heard says she then went to her car. She says her first engagement that day was going to her friend Rocky's beach house.<br>We are looking at a photo taken at 13.58 on the same day. The picture shows Heard on the left of the photo, and Ms. Wass asks her if she was wearing make-up on that occasion. <br>""Yes, I was [wearing make-up]. Absolutely.” <br>Ms. Wass asks: ""Do you ever go out of the house without make-up.” <br>Heard laughs, and says: ""No, I live in LA.” <br>The judge asks for clarification on why this is.<br>Heard answers: ""I'm recognizable, or a celebrity or whatever you want to call it. So I never go out of the house without make up in case I'm photographed.”<br>After going to the beach house, Heard says ""I went to my friend Amanda's birthday party.” She clarifies that this is the British presenter Amanda de Cadenet.<br>Ms. Wass reads out a text from de Cadenet which advises Heard to ""put arnica on it.” <br>Heard explains that arnica is a homeopathic remedy which is said to alleviate bruises and swelling. <br>The judge isn't keen for us to dwell on this topic, so we move on.</p>
<p>We move on to details around 21 April and 21 May incidents (around Heard's birthday and the alleged final argument in LA, when a phone was said to have been thrown by Depp at Heard). <br>We are discussing Heard meeting with Depp near the end of their relationship.<br>Heard says the understanding was that Depp's security and others would always be ""in shouting distance"" of the couple. Heard says she didn't trust Depp's staff to step in and help her, so she always wanted others to be nearby too. <br>Ms. Wass is keen to know exactly how Heard felt about meeting with Depp, but the judge says no, this is a leading question.<br>We talk about the details of the domestic abuse becoming public knowledge.<br>Heard says ""I didn't want to talk about everything that happened in our marriage or relationship. I didn't want the world or his kids to know who he was, and what he could do.""<br>Earlier this week Heard told Depp's lawyer: ""I was trying to save him the embarrassment and this, quite frankly.”<br>Heard now clarifies, and says she was talking about the current court case when she said ""and this,” adding ""I meant no offence to these proceedings.”<br>Ms. Wass asks if her career has benefited from the case.<br>Heard answers: ""What women has ever benefited from being the victim of domestic violence?""<br>Ms. Wass asks if she has benefited financially.<br>Heard says: ""No. I entered into he marriage without a  pre or post-nuptial agreement in a no-fault state. I was entitled to 50% ."" <br>Ms. Wass's final question is: ""Have you told the truth to this court?"" <br>Heard answers: ""Absolutely.”</p>
<p>And with that, Heard has finished giving evidence. She steps down from the witness box. <br>The judge reminds her not to talk to any other witnesses during the case. <br>Heard's sister, Whitney, is due to enter the witness box this afternoon.</p>
<p>I’m not going to give a blow-by-blow accounting of Whitney’s testimony like I did with Amber’s. I think it’s safe to say that she’ll back her sister up on everything. It would be a real shocker if she didn’t.</p>
<p>I’m actually going to call it here. I’ll post the link to the transcript when it becomes available, but quite honestly, I can’t sit here and listen to this nonsense. Whitney’s lying her ass off for her sister, in even more ridiculous ways than I thought she would. Claiming that all the drugs were hers, for example.</p>
<p>Maybe I’m just in a mood today, but it triggers me that a mother would rather spend more than a month (two?) taking part in this fiasco rather than being home with her baby son.</p>
<p>So, I’m off for the day.</p>
<p>More tomorrow.</p>","{'id': '224329221', 'petitionMedium': {'url': '//assets.change.org/photos/8/ye/bt/OwYEBTqoipYxMhz-800x450-noPad.jpg?1595514902', 'processing': False}}",,,,against

<p>Eleanor Laws QC, representing Johnny Depp, is asking Heard about what happened in Australia in March 2015 - an incident the actress has previously described as a ""three-day hostage situation.” <br>Ms.. Laws is asking if Depp was trying to get away from Heard. <br>The actress disagrees. <br>The QC asks if Heard was in a rage - again, she disagrees. <br>Heard is now being asked if she threw a bottle at Depp - again, she disagrees. <br>Ms.. Laws puts it to her that she would throw things at Depp during fights, to which Heard replies. ""I only threw things to escape Johnny when he was beating me up. Sometimes that's all I had.""<br>Ms.. Laws is saying Heard threw a bottle ""forcefully"" at Depp in Australia. <br>Heard says no, that it was Depp who was throwing bottles. <br>Heard says at one point, Depp offered her a bottle. She says she reached to take it and the actor pulled it back, that he was ""taunting me to take it.” <br>She continues: ""He did it again.""</p>
<p>Heard says she was thinking about previous occasions when Depp had told her she had ""saved his life"" by helping him stop drinking. She says at that point she smashed the bottle on the floor. <br>She says she regrets doing this.</p>
<p>Depp then started throwing bottles ""one after the other, right in my direction"", she says. ""I felt glass breaking behind me. I retreated more... he didn't stop. ""I was too scared to look behind me."" <br>The judge asks her to clarify if Depp threw several bottles. The actress says he threw all the bottles there apart from one. <br>""When he was clean and sober he would tell me I saved his life,"" Heard is telling the court. ""When he was clean and sober he was wonderful, that part of him I loved so much."" Everyone around him wanted him ""to be well"" and for him to ""get help"", she says.</p>
<p>Heard is being asked to look at a file now, containing a photograph. <br>The actress says: ""I would be shocked if Johnny remembers any of this hiMs..elf. "" <br>Ms.. Laws interrupts, saying she wants to know about an injury to Depp - we have heard a lot already about how he wounded his finger in Australia. <br>The question Ms.. Laws wants an answer to is that it was ""inconceivable"" that Depp injured hiMs..elf smashing a phone against a wall, the judge tells Heard. <br>The actress disagrees. <br>Depp has accused Heard of throwing a bottle at him, causing the injury. She denies this. <br>She is now being asked about a cigarette burn on Depp's cheek, shown in a photograph. ""Johnny did that,"" Heard says. ""He often did things like that."" <br>Heard denies that it was she who was being violent. <br>Heard is now being asked if it is true that at one stage she was screaming at Depp not to leave and then calling him a ""coward.” <br>She says this is not true.</p>
<p>Ms.. Laws is now asking about Heard's evidence yesterday, moving on from the Australia incident. <br>The court is being played some audio. We can hear a woman's voice but it's pretty quiet (remember, we are in a different courtroom to where the trial is taking place, watching on screen). <br>Now a man's voice. Ms.. Laws says this is a conversation between Heard and Depp.<br>""Sometimes I lose my cool when I get angry,"" Heard says in court, when asked by Ms.. Laws.</p>
<p>Ms.. Laws is now moving on to a different Australia incident, when Heard and Depp infamously took their dogs, Yorkshire Terriers Pistol and Boo, into the country. <br>""It was made quite clear to you... that you couldn't take the dogs into Australia,"" Ms.. Laws is saying to Heard. The actress says she received mixed messages. <br>The court has previously heard evidence from Kevin Murphy, who worked for Depp for almost eight years - he alleged Heard ""demanded"" he make a false statement about the animals being ""smuggled"" into the country. <br>He also claimed Ms.. Heard asked him to contact her former assistant, Kate James, and ask her to ""lie under oath"" to an Australian court about the incident. <br>Mr. Murphy said the actress was ""repeatedly"" told it would be illegal for her to take her two dogs with her to the country. <br>In October 2015, Heard faced criminal proceedings in Australia over the incident. In 2016 she and Depp recorded a now infamous video in 2016 apologizing for doing so.<br>Ms.. Laws is now reading out an email from Mr. Murphy, in which it seeMs.. he is making it clear that the dogs would not be able to travel at the time they wanted to go due to restrictions. <br>Heard says the process went on for a while and was confusing. <br>Speaking about Depp, she says she was travelling on ""his plane"" for ""his movie"" and she thought it had been ""taken care of.” <br>Ms.. Laws said it was laid out in ""black and white"" and that Heard took the decision. <br>""Johnny's the boss,"" Heard says. She says he called the shots. <br>""You got caught,"" Ms.. Laws says. Heard says they both flew in, yet she was the one who got into trouble. She said anything against Depp would have ""compromised Pirates [of the Caribbean]"", which the actor was filming in the country. <br>Heard tells the court: ""I took the blame.""</p>
<p>The judge wants to ask Heard about the charge she faced. Was it for bringing a dog into Australia although she had said ""in some form or other"" that she wasn't bringing a dog into the country? <br>Heard says both she and Depp filled out forMs.. but that because filming of Pirates Of The Caribbean had already been compromised by the earlier incident in Australia (when Depp wounded his finger), she took the blame. <br>Ms.. Laws tells Heard knew she was taking the dogs in without the proper paperwork. <br>Heard says no, she thought they did have the correct paperwork. <br>Ms.. Laws is suggesting that Heard was trying to find someone to take the blame for her. <br>She says no and that she had already pleaded guilty. <br>Ms.. Laws is saying that Heard wanted her former assistant Kate James to lie in a statement about the dogs. <br>Heard says this is incorrect. The actress says she only wanted to show that they had tried to follow protocol.</p>
<p>There is a lot of back and forth about the dogs now. Heard is taking a sip from her water bottle. <br>""Trying to get around official rules is something you've done before,"" Ms.. Laws says. Heard says she doesn't know what the QC means. <br>She says Depp thought things were ""easy"" to take care of in ""his world.” <br>She says she was not in a relationship in which she had ""a lot of choice.” <br>Ms.. Laws puts it to Heard that she blames Depp for things she is accused of. She says this is not the case.</p>
<p>We are now moving on to a different alleged incident, during the couple's honeymoon in July 2015 on a train in southeast Asia. <br>Heard is being shown a photograph in which Depp is apparently injured (we cannot see the photographs they are shown in court). <br>Ms.. Laws says Heard has turned the incident around. The actress denies this. ""He strangled me,"" she tells the court.</p>
<p>Ms.. Laws is now directing Heard to her own account of what took place in a different alleged incident - we have moved on quickly - during which she claiMs.. Depp headbutted her at their penthouse apartment in LA. <br>The QC is reading out the actress's allegations, in which she claiMs.. he punched her and dragged her. <br>Ms.. Laws says this is a ""complete set of lies""; Heard quietly says no. <br>The actress asks for a break ""whenever is convenient.” <br>Ms.. Laws says she wants to finish her point and then we can have a break. <br>Ms.. Laws is talking about nurse Erin Boerum's account of the incident. <br>""You didn't have any bruising at all when you saw Erin Boerum, did you?"" Ms.. Laws says. <br>Heard says she had two black eyes, a broken nose, a ""broken lip"", bruised ribs, ""bruises all over my body.” <br>She says the ""really bad [bruises]"" were on her scalp. There were chunks of hair missing, she says, and it sounds like she is getting upset. <br>Ms.. Laws says this is ""nonsense.” Heard disagrees. <br>The QC asks if she bit her own lip. ""Of course not,"" Heard replies.</p>
<p>After a 10 minute break, Amber Heard gets back in the witness box. She is being directed to a new file by Eleanor Laws QC, representing Depp. <br>Heard is looking at a photo of her alleged injuries and is being asked if she ""played around"" with the images. <br>""I don't know how to,"" Heard replies.<br>This is from December 2015; the next day the actress recorded for James Corden's show. <br>Ms.. Laws is being asked if this is what she looked like on the show - as in, did she look like she does in the photo.<br>Heard says she had her hair and make-up done at home. <br>Ms.. Laws has asked about stylist Samantha McMillen, who saw Heard on that day.<br>Heard says Ms.. McMillen saw her while her make-up was being done. <br>Ms.. McMillen is Depp's stylist, Heard says, but also worked as her stylist while they were a couple. She says it is not true that Ms.. McMillen saw her without make-up on. <br>Ms.. McMillen, who has already given evidence in court, says she saw ""no visible"" injuries the day after Heard claiMs.. Depp was violent. <br>The stylist says she spent ""much of the afternoon and early evening"" with Heard on 16 December 2015, as the star prepared to appear on James Corden's The Late Late Show, and she could ""see clearly"" that Heard had no marks, cuts or bruises. <br>Heard is being asked to look at a picture of Depp and says she can see no mark. <br>She denies injuring him, saying: ""I don't know how I could have."" <br>Heard is now being directed to another photograph, which Ms.. Laws says is of hair Heard alleges was pulled out. <br>Ms.. Laws is suggesting this has been set up, that her hair would have come out at the root. <br>Heard is asked why she took a photo of her scalp if her hair did not break at the root. The actress says her scalp was bleeding. <br>She says this photograph shows just one of many clumps of hair that were pulled out.</p>
<p>We are now being shown a short clip of Heard on Corden's show. <br>The actress confirMs.. it is her. <br>She has bright red lipstick on and is wearing a cream blouse and black tie. <br>""That's what you looked like on the show,"" Ms.. Laws says, and says there is no injury. Heard says she had ""tons of injuries.” <br>Ms.. Laws is now talking about a still taken from footage from the show. She says the actress does not have a split lip. <br>The actress says the reason she wore the red lipstick and make-up is to ""cover"" injuries.</p>
<p>We are now going back to Heard's first allegation of violence against Depp, in early 2013. <br>The couple had moved in together the previous year.<br>In her witness statement, Heard says: ""We were talking about one of his tattoos, which he had had altered from Winona (his ex-partner) to say 'Wino'. I laughed at something he said but he must not have meant it as a joke and he hit me with an open hand across my cheek."" <br>Later in her statement, she says: ""It felt like my eye popped out.""<br>Ms.. Laws asks if Heard is making this up. Heard says she does not agree.</p>
<p><br>Ms.. Laws has moved on again, to an alleged incident in the Bahamas in August 2014. The QC reads from Heard's statement again, in which the actress alleges that Depp grabbed her hair and slapped her. <br>""He was in such a rage that he smashed a door so hard that it splintered,"" she says in her statement.<br>Ms.. Laws is directing Heard to a photograph, and says ""this is not a door from the Bahamas, is it?"" <br>Heard admits it is not but that it was a different door he kicked. <br>Ms.. Laws says Amber has submitted evidence in a ""cavalier"" way. Heard says it was an error. <br>We are now watching a very short clip, with no sound, of the inside of the property in the Bahamas. Heard confirMs.. that it is.</p>
<p>Moving on again, to a trip to Tokyo in January 2015, the month before the couple got married. <br>Heard tells the court she attended a premiere there about two days after Depp was allegedly violent. She says she remembers wearing a backless dress to the event ""very well.” She tells the court her injuries were ""not visible.”</p>
<p>And now to Thanksgiving, November 2015 - we're moving between allegations quite speedily now. <br>In Heard's statement, she says: ""We were in our place in LA. Johnny was using a lot of drugs at the time, especially cocaine and weed, which he was pretty much constantly smoking. ""We got into a fight on Thanksgiving, where Johnny ripped my shirt and threw me across the room. He threw a wine glass and a heavy glass decanter at me, which thankfully both missed me. Once when he pushed me, I fell over the back of a lounge chair and hit my head against the apartment’s exposed brick wall. I noticed later that I had got a lump on the back of my head and a busted lip from this."" <br>Ms.. Laws asks if this is all true. ""Yes, it is,"" Heard replies.</p>
<p>Ms.. Laws has directed Heard to a file and the court is going to be shown a video clip. The footage is very dark; the actress says she can barely see it (neither can we) when asked to confirm where the footage was recorded. <br>She says it looks like one of Depp's penthouses in LA but ""cannot tell"" which one. <br>There are a few people in the clip, including a man flicking a scarf - Heard confirMs.. this is her father, David. Jack, Depp's son, is also there, Heard says. “I believe I hear Marilyn Manson's voice,"" Heard says. <br>Ms.. Laws says everyone is ""joking around"" in the video, and it does sound like people are laughing.<br>Heard is being directed to a photograph; Ms.. Laws asks if it was taken after she received a ""split lip.” <br>The actress says the alleged injury happened after the photo was taken, and that fights with Depp happened after other people had ""gone home"" or ""gone to bed.” <br>Ms.. Laws asks about Heard's friend, Raquel 'Rocky' Pennington, who the actress says she cannot identify in the video (as it's so dark) but confirMs.. she was there.<br>Ms.. Laws is reading from Ms.. Pennington's account. <br>Rocky says that at one point Heard went upstairs to find Depp and they were gone for some period. Ms.. Pennington says Heard told her Depp had thrown a bottle of wine at her, the court hears.<br>Ms.. Laws puts it to Heard that this means the fight took place while others were there - contradicting what she has previously said. <br>Heard says this was just the first ""part"" of the argument.<br>The judge is saying he would find it helpful to have a plan of Depp's penthouses to get more of a sense of where alleged incidents took place - the court is hearing about penthouse five and penthouse three. <br>Erin Boerum, a nurse who treated both Ms.. Heard and Johnny Depp during their relationship, was there on the night of the alleged incident. <br>Heard says she was downstairs during ""part"" of the incident but not later on. <br>""It got much worse later,"" Heard tells the court. <br>Ms.. Laws says this is a ""lie."" <br>Heard replies: ""No, Ma'am.""<br>We are waiting to see a video clip, I think it is, but it appears there are some technical difficulties. <br>Ms.. Laws says she is going to move on.</p>
<p>This part of Heard’s testimony is given in private, with the media and public briefly excluded from the proceedings.</p>
<p>On the heels of Heard’s private testimony, the court adjourns for lunch.</p>
<p>Back in court after lunch, there has been some discussion about the trial timetable as Eleanor Laws QC, representing Depp, has not finished cross-examining Heard. <br>However, the judge has decided we will hear from Joshua Drew, via video-link from LA, first, and he is now giving his affirmation. At the moment, we can hear him but can't see him on the screen in the media room. <br>Mr. Drew is the ex-fiance of Raquel ""Rocky"" Pennington, Heard's friend, and he is being asked about the night of 21 April 2016 - Amber Heard's 30th birthday party.</p>
<p>Mr. Drew agrees with Ms. Laws that Depp was ""coherent"" and ""friendly.” He says his perception was that Depp was ""slightly inebriated.” Mr. Drew's perception was that it was a ""fun"" evening, he says. <br>Ms. Laws is asking Mr. Drew if a lot of the information he had about Depp and Heard's relationship came from Ms. Pennington. <br>Mr. Drew says this is correct and confirMs. he never saw the actor hitting Heard. He says he saw rows between them ""on rare occasions.” <br>(We can see Mr. Drew on the screen now, by the way. He has a beard and glasses and is wearing a grey jacket and a blue shirt.<br>Ms. Laws asks Mr. Drew if he ever saw Heard drink to ""excess"" or taking drugs. He says yes to the drinking and that he has seen Heard take drugs, including mushrooMs., on rare occasions. <br>Ms. Laws is directing Mr. Drew to a deposition he has given.<br>Ms. Laws is now moving on to 21 May 2016, the final alleged incident of violence before Depp and Heard's break-up. <br>Ms.. Laws says Mr. Drew and Ms. Pennington got involved in supporting Heard and lying afterwards. <br>He does not agree. <br>Asked if he saw an assault, he says: ""I did not, as I have stated repeatedly."" <br>Asked if Heard had an injury, he says she did. <br>Ms. Laws says she has no further questions.<br>Sasha Wass, representing NGN, wants to clarify on Heard's drug use. <br>Mr. Drew confirMs. he has never seen the actress take cocaine. <br>Ms. Wass is saying to Mr. Drew that it's being suggested that Heard was not injured when he saw her following the alleged incident in LA in May 2016. <br>Ms. Wass is directing him to a photograph of Heard, which he confirMs. he can see. <br>She then directs him to metadata attached to the photograph, but the judge cuts this short. <br>Asked by Ms. Wass, Mr. Drew says he was present when photos were taken and when police arrived at the property. <br>He says he was present when photographs of damage in the property was taken. <br>Mr. Drew is being asked to describe a print-out of a photograph but he says he cannot see it as it's too dark.<br>He is being directed to another, but he says this is just as dark. <br>Ms. Wass asks if photos can be shown on screen instead. This might take a second or two.</p>
<p>This picture shows Amber Heard and Johnny Depp with staff from the Eastern Oriental, the luxury sleeper train they took in Malaysia on their honeymoon in August 2015. <br><a href=""https://storify.com/services/proxy/2/5G5tLYWq8v9a0FIkrEdSbw/https/media.fyre.co/vrUoqxFZS2SiKeGQ8m9e_2.54688258.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">https://storify.com/services/proxy/2/5G5tLYWq8v9a0FIkrEdSbw/https/media.fyre.co/vrUoqxFZS2SiKeGQ8m9e_2.54688258.jpg</a> <br>Heard said in her written statement they got into an argument on the train and Depp pushed her up against the wall of their cabin and tore her shirt, exposing her breast as he screamed, hit her face and choked her before he let go.</p>
<p><br>The judge is reminding the court of the time pressures and says there has been a technical difficulty so Ms. Wass is going to continue her questioning. <br>Wass asks Mr. Drew if he can remember what damage there was to the property (we are talking about Depp's LA penthouses - Mr. Drew and Ms. Pennington lived in one at the time). <br>""In the hallway... there was a pretty substantial pool of red wine, there was a dent in the door of the penthouse that Raquel and I occupied,"" he says. This was penthouse one. <br>“In penthouse three there was broken glass"", he says. “In penthouse five there was a variety of things that had been thrown about.” He says there was glass from a broken picture frame on the floor and piles of books that had been ""shoved around.” <br>Ms. Wass asks if Mr. Drew took photographs and he says he believes he did. <br>Did he see how the damage was caused? <br>“No,” he says. He also says he did not cause the damage. <br>Ms. Wass asks what he recalls about his interaction with the police. <br>Mr. Drew says his initial recollection is not completely clear ""after all these years"" but he says he greeted the officers and ""walked them through the damage myself.”<br>The witness says he took them back to penthouse three, where Heard was, and the female officer said she wanted to speak to the actress privately. <br>The witness says he stayed outside with the male officer and asked ""what we could do.”</p>
<p>Mr. Drew has now finished giving evidence and again, there is some legal argument about the time being taken. Ms. Laws isn't happy.</p>
<p>While we are having a short break, back to the couple's honeymoon, which was discussed earlier. <br>This picture shows Amber Heard and Johnny Depp with staff from the Eastern and Oriental Express, the luxury sleeper train they took in Malaysia on their honeymoon in August 2015. <br>Heard said in her written statement they got into an argument on the train and Depp pushed her up against the wall of their cabin and tore her shirt, exposing her breast as he screamed, hit her face and choked her before he let go. She might have gotten away with this testimony except that in photos, her neck is free of injuries, pale and perfect. She debunks herself. Depp, on the other hand, sports injuries that she inflicted upon him, unless she’s willing to say that he does it hiMs.elf.</p>
<p>After a very short break, Melanie Inglessis is being sworn in now via video-link.</p>
<p>In 2015, she was a professional make-up artist, she tells the court.<br>She says she first did Heard's make-up in 2015 and continued to do so for the next few years. She says she has met Johnny Depp and seen him about ""five or six times.” She says interactions with Depp were ""lovely.”<br>Asked if she spoke to Heard about her relationship, she says they had ""many"" conversations ""about her relationship with Johnny.”</p>
<p>Our source has decided to cut out the xe by Ms. Laws and go straight to the redirect by Ms.. Wass. But fear not, the full transcripts will be posted later by the ever-reliable Nick Wallis. You can read the whole thing, then. I know I will.</p>
<p><br>Ms. Inglessis is being asked by Ms. Wass about the restraining order filed by Heard after her break-up with Depp. <br>The witness says it was not out of the blue to her. <br>Ms. Wass asks about 15 December 2015, the day before Heard recorded James Corden's show. ""Can you tell us what you saw of Amber's face on that day?"" <br>Ms. Inglessis says she was supposed to go bowling with Heard and she never showed up. She says Heard sent a text later on saying she had had a fight with Depp; Ms. Inglessis says she went to their penthouse and saw broken glass on the floor and damage to the bed upstairs, as well as writing on the kitchen worktop. <br>Ms. Wass asks about Heard's condition. Ms. Inglessis says she was ""erratic"", ""upset"" and there was ""a lot of emotion.” <br>The witness says Heard told her she and Depp had had a fight and that the actor had tried to suffocate her with a pillow and dragged her by her hair. <br>Ms. Inglessis tells the court she had to do Heard's make-up the following day, for Corden's show. The witness says Heard had ""discoloration"" near her eyes, that her left eye was a little more bruised than the right eye. The bridge of Heard's nose was red and swollen, she says, and Heard had a cut or scab on her lip. <br>Ms. Wass asks what they talked about while Ms. Inglessis was doing Heard's make-up. <br>She says they talked about the incident the night before, that the actress told her how her alleged injuries happened. <br>The witness says she applied a full face of make-up and that although it was not uncommon for Heard to wear full red lipstick, she remembers that the discussion that day was that she had no other choice because she needed to cover an injury on her lip. <br>Ms. Wass asks how effective concealer is; Ms. Inglessis says it is ""very effective"" on bruises and that they were no longer visible once her make-up had been applied. <br>Heard said 15 December 2015 was one of the worst ""one of the worst and most violent nights"" of their relationship, with Depp throwing a decanter at her, slapping her and dragging her by her hair around their penthouse before headbutting her and saying he would kill her. <br>The next day she was due on The Late Show with James Corden, which Joshua Drew, the then partner of her friend Raquel ""Rocky"" Pennington, said Heard told them she could not drop out of.</p>
<p>After a few questions from Ms. Laws, Ms. Inglessis says she is not lying about what she saw. She tells the court she did not want to give evidence in the case. <br>The judge has now thanked her and we will be moving back to Heard again shortly.</p>
<p>Heard is now back in the witness box and Eleanor Laws QC, representing Depp, is questioning her. She wants to move on to a short point about Heard's restraining order against the actor, she says, after their break-up in 2016. <br>Ms. Laws says Heard was ""not limited"" to what she could or couldn't say. <br>Heard says no, she was told by her attorney to ""keep it brief"" and had no personal knowledge of how she should proceed. <br>There was no need for Heard to attend the courthouse for an appearance about it, Ms. Laws says. ""No, I don't think so,"" Heard says. <br>Ms. Laws says this is a lie. <br>Heard says this is not true, that her attorney told her she had to ""show up.”</p>
<p>We are now returning to Thanksgiving 2015, and a video that could not be played earlier. It is a longer clip and we can hear people laughing in it. <br>Ms. Heard confirMs. this was filmed in penthouse five and she can see her friend Raquel ""Rocky"" Pennington, herself, Depp, her father, Depp's son Jack and a woman with dark hair. Heard says this looks like a friend of Depp's named Pat. <br>""This is a happy family event, isn't it?"" Ms. Laws says. <br>""Yes, it is,"" Heard replies. However, she says it is ""untrue"" that there was no violence on that night. She says the two things are ""unrelated.” <br>Ms. Laws says the video was timestamped after midnight. Before this, they had had a ""brief altercation"", Heard says, but ""relative to other things it was pretty minor.”<br>The court is being shown once again the other video from Thanksgiving, which we have seen already. <br>Ms. Laws asks Heard about ""the other side"" of Depp, ""the monster,"" that she has described previously - is this a lie? <br>Heard says no. <br>The words ""savage"" and ""monster"" can be heard being said by Marilyn Manson in the video - the court previously heard he was there on that evening - which Heard agrees sound like a joke in the clip. <br>Asked if these words were used as a joke between them, Heard says this was ""Johnny and his friends.”</p>
<p>Ms. Laws is now moving on to an alleged incident in the Bahamas in December 2015. <br>She reads from the witness statement of Depp's estate manager, Tara Roberts, who said in her witness statement that Heard was ""repeatedly berating"" the actor ""with increasing ferocity.” Ms. Roberts continued: ""She was insulting him, calling him names, and in the middle of this onslaught I heard her say specifically 'your career is over', 'no one is going to hire you', 'you’re washed up', 'fat', “you will die a lonely man'."" <br>Ms. Heard says these words were said, but actually by Depp, not her.<br>Seriously?<br>That is it for Ms. Laws's cross-examination of the actress. <br>Sasha Wass, for NGN, is going to ask Heard some questions now. <br>Ms. Wass is asking about substance abuse. Heard tells the court she has never had treatment for drug or alcohol abuse of any kind.<br>She admits she did throw a can as she was ""running away"" from the actor.</p>
<p>Ms. Laws accused Heard of ""concocting"" her accusations of violence. ""Mr. Depp has never assaulted you, it has always been you that starts the fight and the rows."" <br>The judge asks for those parts to be answered separately. <br>Heard says that it is ""untrue"" that Depp never assaulted her and ""untrue"" that she always instigated fights.</p>
<p>Heard admits she has used cocaine a few times. Asked about alcohol, she says she has never had a problem but chose to stop drinking spirits and most other alcohol when she was 19 due to her background - she has previously said her parents are alcoholics. <br>She says she drinks red wine occasionally.<br>Ms. Wass is asking if Heard has taken cocaine since she was a teenager. <br>""One time I did, many years after the divorce,"" Heard says. The judge says we can move on. <br>Heard says she never took cocaine while she was with Depp and never encouraged him to take the drug either. <br>Ms. Wass asks if Heard has ever self-harmed; the actress says she never has: ""I have never cut myself, ever.""<br>Ms. Wass asks Heard about previous evidence she has given claiming Depp has self-harmed. <br>""His body's full of... scars... I saw him do it to hiMs.elf,"" Heard says.<br>The court is hearing about a mark on Depp's cheek, which Heard says was inflicted by Depp.<br>Ms. Wass asks about Heard's claim that the actor put out a cigarette out on his face. <br>""It was deliberate,"" Heard says. The actress says Depp was saying he didn't feel it as he was already in so much pain. <br>She says Depp had taken cocaine and other drugs at this point.</p>
<p>Ms. Wass is directing Heard to look in a file now (we can see quite a lot of big files behind the actress in the witness box). <br>She wants to ask about the actress's relationship with Tasya van Ree, who she was with when she met Depp. <br>Ms. Wass is reading an email from Ms. van Ree which says that Heard was ""wrongfully accused"" of an incident in 2009, which we have heard about previously. <br>""Was there any truth in the suggestion that you assaulted or beat Ms. van Ree ever?"" Ms. Wass asks. <br>""Absolutely not,"" Heard says, and adds that they had a ""beautiful"" and ""peaceful"" relationship and good friendship after they broke up. <br>The judge says the answer is ""no.” <br>Ms. Wass is asking about Heard's friend and former assistant Savannah McMillan. <br>The actress has previously answered questions on her from Ms. Laws, about her pay and her title. <br>Ms. Wass is asking about times when Heard travelled abroad and Ms. McMilan was with her - did she work for Heard or someone else? <br>Heard gives specific filMs. she worked on and says production companies paid Ms. McMillan. <br>The court has previously heard how Heard send a letter to Homeland Security officials in the US in 2014, about Ms. McMillan, who is British, to indicate that she was not working ""illegally"" in the US. <br>Heard tells the court the letter was composed by Ms. McMillan but she signed it. <br>Heard tells the court that when flying into the US, Ms. McMillan was detained for several hours, which is when she first learned that there might be a problem.</p>
<p>That’s it for today. There will be a full transcript up a bit later, and I’ll edit this update to include it, if I can. I can’t say that I look forward to reading all of this again with the omitted parts in place, but I’ll do it. Johnny deserves that justice.</p>
<p>Suffice it to say that I’m blown away by Heard’s allegation that Johnny did all that crap to himself in Australia. Cut his own finger off? Burned his own face with a cigarette? It boggles the mind, on top of all the other spinning, manipulation and outright lying that took place today.</p>

StarterPetitionUpdate,27343904,2020-07-21T15:54:06.000Z,,dc-entertainment-remove-amber-heard-from-aquaman-2,"Amber in the hot seat, day 2","<p>Amber showed up wearing a cream colored blouse and fawn colored jacket, with her hair braided up over her head. She is again being questioned by Eleanor Laws QC, representing Johnny Depp. <br>Johnny arrived late. <a href=""https://storify.com/services/proxy/2/hn63AieJXM7Zwke917XeNQ/https/media.fyre.co/orwZ625MS.kyRa7CgPe4Q_2020-07-21T092751Z_1701038136_RC2LXH9J38CJ_RTRMADP_3_BRITAIN-PEOPLE-DEPP.JPG"" rel=""nofollow"">https://storify.com/services/proxy/2/hn63AieJXM7Zwke917XeNQ/https/media.fyre.co/orwZ625MS.kyRa7CgPe4Q_2020-07-21T092751Z_1701038136_RC2LXH9J38CJ_RTRMADP_3_BRITAIN-PEOPLE-DEPP.JPG</a></p>
<p><br>The last time he showed up late, it was because of a meeting he had about a new role, so it’s possible that today’s tardiness is related to that.</p>
<p>They picked up where they left off, about Johnny on a rampage the night Amber claimed that he threw a phone at her face, destroying everything he could, from Penthouse 3 where they lived, to the penthouse where Rocky Pennington (RP) kept her beads. She called him crazed and delusional.</p>
<p>There was a quick chat about what pronoun to use for iO Tillet Wright (iO). Amber explains that iO now prefers the female pronoun “she.”  Heard is shown CCTV footage of herself with concierge Cornelius Harrell in March 2016, and reluctantly admits that it’s her. Mr. Harrell has given statements for court that Amber had no marks on her face. Amber disagrees, naturally. Ms. Laws mentions all the other people who also said she didn’t have any marks on her. Were they all lying?</p>
<p>Next, Heard is asked about a series of tweets between herself and Elon Musk (EM), but insists that she didn’t have any affairs with anyone while she was with Johnny, not even EM. She wasn’t even in communication with him, she claiMs., until 2016. She says an earlier witness, Alejandro Romero, is wrong about seeing her with Musk at an earlier date.</p>
<p>There is a little back and forth now between Ms. Laws and the judge over whether talk of jealousy is relevant. Heard says in some ways ""all jealousy is illogical.” The judge is not keen to get into philosophical conversations, and moves the subject on.</p>
<p>The court is now being shown CCTV footage which shows Heard in a lift with actor James Franco. Ms. Laws asks if it is indeed Franco, and Heard says yes. Heard says Franco was saying: ""Oh my god, what happened to you?"" when he saw her face after she went down to let him in. She says his words were ""What the f***.” Ms. Laws asks if they were ""trying to hide their faces"" in the video, and Heard says no. Ms. Laws asks if it was ""secretive talking.” Heard says it was ""discreet talking.”</p>
<p>We now move onto other events around May 2016. Heard says a text she sent at the time saying she was fearful of Depp was correct, telling Ms. Laws: ""That is true, I was petrified of the monster.” We also hear about part of Heard's statement, in which she says she went to her friends Rocky and Josh's apartment (which was in the same apartment block) to seek refuge from Depp following a big argument on 21 May 2016. In it, she says ""I did not hear from Johnny any more.”</p>
<p>Ms. Laws reads out multiple texts sent by Heard to Depp's late head of security Jerry Judge on 24 May 2016, which seem to show her trying to get in contact with Depp. One reads, ""Please call me as soon as you get this""; another ""I'm desperately trying to reach Johnny, can you help?"" and another ""I love you precious.” Heard agrees she was trying to reach Depp. <br>Ms. Laws says this is not the truth, as she was in contact with Depp between 21 and 26 May. But Heard says she was referring to that night, and the incident, and saying she did not see Depp any more that night. Ms. Laws says this is not true.</p>
<p>We now see a letter written by Heard's lawyer to Depp's lawyer on 24 May 2016, asking for their separation to be kept out of the public eye. Ms. Laws asks Heard: ""You didn't want publicity around this did you?"" Heard agrees. Heard says her lawyer ""told me I needed only the last couple of instances of violence, which had ironically been the last couple of times I saw Johnny.” The letter says there had been three instances of domestic violence in the last six months. When asked by Ms. Laws which instances these are, Heard says ""there are honestly so many, I don't recall which ones they are.” Ms. Laws says: ""Just days before this case started you remembered lots of new cases of alleged violence.” Ms. Heard says this is not true.</p>
<p>The judge explains to Heard that what Ms. Laws is getting at is that if there had been more instances of domestic violence, they would have been included in the letter. Heard says this is not so, and her lawyer said it was ""a short application.” Ms. Laws counters: ""You make things up as you go along.” That’s the second time in two days that Ms. Laws has used that statement. And IMHO, she was right both times.</p>
<p>On the 23 May, Heard filed for divorce. Ms. Laws says several people - Depp's artist friend Isaac Baruch and concierge manager Trinity Esparza - saw Heard on this day and both say Heard had no injuries. Heard says she doesn't recall seeing Ms. Esparza, but she does vaguely recall seeing Mr Baruch.</p>
<p>The following day, 24 May, Ms. Laws says Amber did see housekeeper Hilda Vargas. She also says she disputes Ms. Vargas's claim that she wasn't wearing make-up.</p>
<p>We also discuss stylist Samantha McMillan, who also said she saw Heard without make up, and saw no injuries. Heard disagrees and says: ""She has only seen me at photo shoots.” She says she only ever saw her with make up on. Heard says she would put make up on first thing in the day, and that as she is often photographed, this was how she would always appear. <br>Ms. Laws asks if that meant Ms. McMillan always arrived late to shoots. Ms. Laws says it is ""inconceivable"" Ms. McMillan would not have seen Heard without make up at some point. <br>Heard says this is not so.</p>
<p><br>Ms. Laws says the letter from Heard's lawyer to Depp's was a form of ""blackmail.” You know, the one where she demanded everything from the apartment and his car to spousal support, right down to Johnny paying for Amber’s laundry. Heard says this is not so, and that she wanted to let him know ""this could be done amicably.” <br>Heard says she was not afraid to talk to Depp on the phone, but was afraid of him. Ms. Laws says this is not true, and that Heard was not afraid of Depp, she was simply wanting it to seem like she was.</p>
<p>The court is now being shown more CCTV footage - it is black and white with no sound - and shows Heard in the lift with her sister and Rocky Pennington. They are heading out of the apartment. Ms. Laws says it shows Herd - who is on the far left - had no bruise on her cheek. In similar footage, as the three women return home that night, we can again see Heard standing by the lift doors. Heard says it was at around 10 or 11pm. Ms. Laws now moves on to a few hours later, in the early hours of the same night. Heard says ""my memory is not clear"" on events on that night. Ms. Laws says she would remember if she called her lawyer first that night. Talking again about the letter between lawyers, which mentions three alleged domestic violence incidents, Heard says: ""I was trying to protect Johnny. I wasn't ready to reveal everything I'd been trying to hide for four-and-a-half years.”</p>
<p>Heard is discussing texts she sent to Depp around the time she filed for divorce. She says: ""I wanted him to understand I loved him, and it didn't need to be any more acrimonious than it already was.  I just wanted privacy.” She goes on: ""As naive as it sounds, at the time, just a few days of privacy seemed like an enormous thing to me.” One text from Heard says: ""I thought you'd filed.” Heard confirMs. this meant she thought Depp had or was going to file for divorce.</p>
<p>Another lift clip is shown to the court, this time in color and filmed on the 23 May 2016. Heard is in the lift with Rocky and interior designer Laura Divenere. Ms. Laws says they were all up close in the lift. Now a second clip of the lobby is being played, showing Heard in the lobby taking to Ms. Esparza. Again, they are talking over the desk and seem very close to one another. ""You had no injury did you?"" Ms. Laws asks. She goes on, ""And it's wrong to say you rarely communicated with the staff.” <br>Heard answers: ""Ms. Laws, I lived in that flat a long time and I talked to them on occasions.” She says she did not “often” talk with them.</p>
<p>Ms. Laws references a clip where she says Heard and her sister Whitney ""acted out some sort of punching scene.” <br>Heard says this is not true. We are not shown any clip of this.</p>
<p>Ms. Laws asks if Heard saw Isaac Baruch after she had filed for a restraining order. She asks: ""Did you see him afterwards, and ask him out to dinner?"" <br>Heard answers: ""I did see him, but I didn't ask him out to dinner, I asked him if he wanted something I had cooked. He liked my cooking.”</p>
<p>We now move on to a telephone call between Depp and Heard. Heard says she believes this call is ""one Johnny asked me if I was recording, and I said no, and he recorded it."" Ms. Laws says: ""Let's be clear, this is a recording you have provided yourself. So you know about this call.” In this phone call, reference is made to a ""secret fight club.” Ms. Laws says that when she asked Heard if she knew which transcript they were discussing, and mentioned ""secret fight club"" she denied knowledge of it. Heard denies this, and says it's because Ms. Laws ""mis-spoke.” Ms. Laws says Heard has made the point ""four times"" that she didn't know which transcript Ms. Laws was talking about, and she is now moving on. Ms. Laws asks: ""Are you unhappy that you recorded this conversation?.” Heard says no, she is unhappy that Depp told her he wasn't recording the conversation, and then she found out he was. She says they often recorded conversations between theMs.elves. Ms. Laws says Heard received ""bad publicity after she filed"" and Heard was ""angry about this.” Heard says: ""I was angry, but mostly heartbroken. My marriage had ended, it was a really hard time.” Ms. Laws says during the recorded phone conversation violence from the past is discussed. Ms. Laws reads out an extract from the transcript in which Depp says ""I had a jar of mineral spray thrown at my f***ing nose.” It also mentions him losing the tip of his finger and Heard allegedly being violent towards him. Ms. Laws puts it to Heard that she had been violent to Depp, and she didn't deny it in the call. <br>Heard says: ""I wasn't in a place to deny or agree to it. I was trying to point out to him the reality of the system and how nasty, and violent this whole thing had been.” She goes on: ""Johnny surrounded hiMs.elf with people who wouldn't disagree with him.” She says he was ""almost never in contact with outside world.” Heard says Depp ""severed his own finger.” She says Depp's ""perception of our relationship was so skewed"" he didn't realise how bad things were. Heard says: ""He was twice my size and beat me up for years.” She says ""it's preposterous"" Depp says he was the victim of violence. <br>IMHO, what’s preposterous is Heard saying that Johnny is twice her size. She stands nearly as tall as him, and is perfectly capable of swinging a fist.</p>
<p>Like yesterday, Amber’s making good use of her water bottle, sipping from it liberally.</p>
<p>We are now talking about the night of Heard's 30th birthday party on 21 May 2016. Ms. Laws asks if when Depp arrived he was ""coherent, sociable, logical and you were affectionate towards one another.” <br>Heard says, ""Yes, but he was also under the influence and high.” Ms. Laws says Heard is the only one alleging that, and Heard says that's not true.</p>
<p>We hear that Depp had received ""monumental news"" about his finances that evening, before arriving at the birthday meal. During Depp's evidence last week he told the court he lost $650m when former business managers ""stole"" his money.</p>
<p>Ms. Laws reads out texts from Depp to Heard, which seem to show Depp apologising for being late. There is a little confusion over the date of these texts, and Heard says she thinks they might be from the day before the birthday party. Confusingly, the texts are actually dated the 22nd May, which would make them the day after. <br>Heard says she thinks they are from before the party, as they mention ""fittings for the Met Gala.” She has to repeat ""Met Gala"" for the judge, who doesn't seem too familiar with the event.</p>
<p>Ms. Laws says Heard knew Depp had an important meeting with his accountant, and Heard says is aware that he had the meeting. Ms. Laws says after the party Heard ""went on and on"" at Depp over being late. Heard says she was ""upset he was late for my birthday.” <br>Heard says he had scheduled his meeting just half an hour before her celebratory meal, and was still late. Ms. Laws asks whether Heard ""punched Depp in the face"" on that night. Heard replied ""Absolutely not.” <br>Ms. Laws says Depp called his security guard Sean Bett to come and get him. <br>Heard says, ""Johnny didn't drive, he was driven. It was normal for him to call someone to drive him after he would beat-up on me.” <br>We hear a text exchange in which Depp says Heard ""hay-makered me.” This US phrase means to punch wildly. Ms. Laws says Heard did not dispute this in the texts.</p>
<p>The following day Heard's friend Rocky came to her flat, and Ms. Laws says Heard did not tell her Depp had hit her. Heard says this is not true, and she had texted Rocky the night before to tell her there had been an incident. ""When she [Rocky] walked into the room it was covered in glass from things Johnny had thrown at me. Johnny was fond of glass bottles.” Heard says Rocky saw all the damage. That day Heard, her sister and a group of friends headed out to Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival. <br>Heard is asked if she was excited about going to Coachella. <br>Heard answers: ""I couldn't be excited, my husband had beaten me up on my 30th birthday.” <br>Ms. Laws asks: ""And then you excreted on the bed?"" <br>Heard says she did not, and ""it's absolutely disgusting.” <br>Ms. Laws asks if it was one of Heard's friends who had messed on the bed, and Heard says no, it's ""unimaginable to me.” <br>Heard says Yorkshire Terrier Boo had had a problem with messing herself ""since the weed.” She explains that when Boo was a puppy she ate a bag of Depp's marijuana, and had had issues since then. <br>Heard is asked if cleaner Hilda Vargas regularly cleaned up after the dogs (Pistol and Boo), and Heard says occasionally. <br>Heard says she would usually clean up excrement in the bed as she thought it was unfair for the cleaner to have to deal with it. Heard says Boo would often cuddle with Johnny, and mess herself on him or the bed. She says she heard Ms. Vargas giving evidence last week. In that, we heard that Ms. Vargas believed the excrement to be human rather than animal. ""I cannot imagine what kind of human being would do that for a prank or joke"" Heard tells the court. She says she was not there though, and had headed to Coachella by this time. Heard says she does not recall if she took the dogs with her or not.</p>
<p>We are now moving on to what Ms. Laws calls the ""bathroom incident.” Heard says there were many incidents involving the bathroom, and involving doors, so asks for more clarity on which incident this was. The court is about to be played some audio, which we are told is undated. We can hear Depp talking in this, but his voice is very muted. He seeMs. to be apologising for closing the door into Heard's toes. He says: ""I didn't mean to do that.” We can now hear Heard, who is saying she did not mean to push the door into Depp, but reacted to the door hitting her toes. She says ""It was not my intention.” We can hear Heard saying ""I'm so sorry. I can remember hitting you as a response. And I'm really sorry about hitting you in the head with the door.” She goes on, ""I just reacted and I'm sorry, it's below me."" <br>Ms. Laws asks: ""You admitted punching him in the face there?"" <br>Heard says: ""No.” <br>Ms. Laws says: ""And it was not in self-defence was it?"" <br>Heard answers: ""That's exactly what it was.” She says at the time Depp was ""falling against the door and screaming out incoherently.” <br>She says she had previously kept an eye on him to check he wasn't choking on his own vomit. She says she ""pushed the door as an instinct. to get it off of me as it was putting pressure on my body.” Heard says: ""I knew better than to fight with him about the details of the fight, and what he perceived as injuries to him. My job was to say sorry, and get him on track, and move on to bigger things.” She says doing so would have ""made him more mad, enraged, and he would have got more violent with me.” <br>Ms. Laws says every time there is evidence showing Ms. Heard admitting to violence, she ""turns it round"" and alleges self-defence. ""It's what you do isn't it?"" Ms. Laws adds.</p>
<p>We are now about to be played audio of another conversation between Depp and Heard. Again, this audio is hard to hear. We hear Heard saying: ""You're trying to justify how you do or don't come to the door.” <br>Depp says: ""You seem to think there's this cowardice in me, running away from me.” He says ""the only time I did things to you was when you threw the can at me in Australia.” <br>We hear Heard saying she ""threw pots and pans.” <br>Ms. Laws asks if Heard said in the audio that was in self-defence? <br>Heard answers ""that was not the point of the conversation.”<br>Ms. Laws says in this case Heard ""does not want to ever admit to using violence against Mr Depp. You don't want to admit the truth - that you were violent do you?"" <br>Heard says this is not true.</p>
<p>We now hear about what Ms. Laws calls the stair incident, which Ms. Laws says was ""very violent.” <br>Ms. Heard says she was only ever violent ""in defence of myself and my sister.” <br>Ms. Laws says Heard spat at Depp. <br>Heard answers: ""I never spit at anyone"" <br>Ms. Laws says Heard threw a can of Red Bull at Depp's back. <br>Heard answers: ""I don't even drink Red Bull, no.” <br>Ms. Laws says Heard punched Depp in the face. <br>Heard agrees: ""I did strike Johnny that day, in defence of my sister.” <br>Heard says the reason for this is: ""I heard the rumour he pushed an ex-girlfriend down the stairs - I think it was Kate Moss - and that was fresh in my mind. So I reacted quickly."" Heard goes on: ""I have been Johnny's punching bag for years. And I remember this as it was the first incident when I ever struck him back. Ms. Laws puts it to Heard that this is the first time she has ever mentioned Kate Moss in relation to this incident. <br>For a second (third) time Ms. Laws tells Heard: ""You are making this up as you go along.” <br>Ms. Laws says there has been no mention of Moss in Heard's deposition, and she has never before said this was the reason she ""punched Depp"" during the stair incident. The court is now being played Heard's deposition, which was also shown in court yesterday. In the deposition Heard is asked ""have you ever hit Johnny Depp?"" <br>Heard is told by her lawyers, ""You don't have to answer.”<br>She says she was protecting ""my baby sister"" and she jumped up to ""act defensively to protect her life.” She says ""I would have done anything to prevent her from being pushed down the stairs. She says any sibling or parent would do the same. <br>Ms. Laws asks why she didn't mention Moss in the deposition. <br>Heard says: ""I didn't have a chance.” <br>Ms. Laws asks if Heard has mentioned Moss in any statement, deposition or evidence so far. <br>Heard agrees she has not. Heard says ""She had anything but the freedom to speak"" and was ""surrounded by 14 lawyers"" on the recorded deposition shown to the court. <br><a href=""https://storify.com/services/proxy/2/LMT5MrirBwU7b3aoqCnRWg/https/media.fyre.co/RU3QItsVTziZ05gQGGlH_GettyImages-75480804.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">https://storify.com/services/proxy/2/LMT5MrirBwU7b3aoqCnRWg/https/media.fyre.co/RU3QItsVTziZ05gQGGlH_GettyImages-75480804.jpg</a> <br>For a third (fourth) time Ms. Laws says: ""You are making this up as you go along sometimes. You add information you have thought of on your feet to try to make your account more detailed.” <br>Heard refutes this.</p>
<p>We have now moved on to an alleged attack on Heard by Depp on 23 March 2015, when he is said to have pulled her by the hair and hit her.</p>
<p>Heard tells the court: ""He hit me with the hard plaster cast, and my sister Whitney. It was particularly unpleasant.” <br>At the time Depp had his finger in a cast due to an injury sustained in Australia. He chose one of the children's designs for the cast, with a picture of a baby dinosaur on in. <br>Ms. Laws asks why she did not mention the cast in her statement. Heard says she cannot mention every accessory or detail of every incident.</p>
<p>After the lunch break, the court is shown a photo of Heard with Rolling Stone Keith Richards, along with her sister. Heard confirMs. she is second left in the picture. <br>Ms. Laws asks Heard if it's correct there is no bruise on her cheek. <br>Heard says she cannot tell.<br><a href=""https://storify.com/services/proxy/2/rRkWYKCWHX99xoLSA3I_xg/https/media.fyre.co/8pCmJR7gRWjNEXyPkoHs_Keith%20Richards%20photo.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">https://storify.com/services/proxy/2/rRkWYKCWHX99xoLSA3I_xg/https/media.fyre.co/8pCmJR7gRWjNEXyPkoHs_Keith%20Richards%20photo.jpg</a> <br>Heard says this photo was taken ""right before"" the painting incident. She says her previous reference to ""disco bloodbath"" was actually in relation to another fight, not the argument over a painting by her ex-partner Tasya Van Ree. Heard has alleged Depp hit her because the picture was hung up in her bedroom, and that Depp tried to set fire to art work.</p>
<p>Ms. Laws now asks detailed questions about the ""disco bloodbath"" fight. She asks: ""How did he hit you in such a way that blood spattered on the wall?"" <br>Heard says: ""Back then it was just slaps or backhands, and at the time it was a shock. I felt his rings hit my mouth, my teeth."" <br>Ms. Laws asks: ""How close were you?"" <br>Heard answers: ""We were at his downtown place in the Eastern Columbia building. All the details of these incidents remain true. I remember them perfectly. There has been a mistake with dates. That particular incident which we called disco bloodbath happened on the 8th, downtown. "" <br>Ms. Laws now tries to interrupt, but the judge cuts in saying: ""It's easier if I can hear one person at a time.” He says Hurd is answering the question, and he wants to hear it. <br>Heard goes on: ""All I can tell you is Johnny wore these rings. He backhanded me. We got into an argument because he said I'd had affairs with two people I never had an affair with.” Heard says the blow ""popped my teeth.” She says she was standing next to the living room, and she recalls ""the next day there was blood next to the Smeg fridge. The next day Johnny made a joke about it.” Heard says the wall was around two or three feet away from her at the time. <br>Ms. Laws is keen to know the angle and exact proximity. <br>Ms. Laws is now asking: ""What did the blood spatter look like?"" <br>Heard says she cannot recall, going on: ""We made light of it. It's hard to believe, but I was so quick to think it would never happen again."" <br>""How many drops of blood?,” Ms. Laws asks. <br>The judge interrupts again and says he doesn't think knowing the exact amount of blood is helpful.<br>Ms. Laws is putting it to Heard that she changed her account of the date of the alleged painting incident as there was the Keith Richards photo showing her with a clear face the day after the alleged fight. <br>Ms. Laws says Heard shifted the painting fight to 22 March 2013, and said the disco bloodbath fight happened on the 8 March. <br>Heard says no, she had no need to change the dates, and that she has always said the disco bloodbath was on 8 March. <br>The judge asks for clarification of what ""disco bloodbath"" means. <br>Heard says: ""He hit me, and split my lip, a blood went on the wall and on my shirt.” She says the phrase was used by Depp later, and is the title of a book. She says she asked him if that was in reference to the alleged fight on Friday. <br>Ms. Laws tells Heard she has ""missed an important detail"" in her statement, and that's why she changed the date. <br>Heard says that is not the case, but says there were ""so many incidents in March"" that she got mixed up as to what happened at each one.</p>
<p>We are now looking at the Keith Richards photo again, and Amber says she can't be sure there isn't damage to her face. She says: ""My bottom lip looks swollen to me.” <br>Sasha Wass, the lawyer for The Sun, has now interjected. <br>The judge is getting a little cross over lawyers in court talking over each other, and says for a second time he can only listen to one person at a time.</p>
<p>Heard is now being asked to look at screen shots taken on 7 April 2013. <br>Ms. Laws says we will also be discussing flight details relating to a man called Ian Patrick McLagan, who has played the guitar for the Rolling Stones.<br>Ms. Laws asks, ""You have seen these documents before haven't you?"" <br>Heard says she has seen so many documents she can't tell, and then adds ""I don't think I have seen this.” <br>Ms. Laws says it's these flight details that have caused Heard to change her dates in her earlier statement. <br>Heard refutes this.<br>The documents include an email chain about flights and travel to set. Depp's lawyer Stephen Deuters is cc'd in.</p>
<p>Ms. Heard says she ""vaguely recognizes"" the second photo with Ian Patrick McLagan.</p>
<p>Ms. Laws says Heard hasn't just changed the dates, she has also ""shifted the more lurid and graphic"" accounts to earlier in the timeline (specifically 8 March), to explain her clear face in the dated photos.<br>Ms. Laws says Heard is ""treading a fine line"" as her sister Whitney has already said in her statement that Heard had a split lip after the painting incident. <br>Heard says no, the truth is that Depp ""hit me a lot in March."" <br>We now look at Heard's sister's statement - Whitney Henriquez - talking about arriving at Heard's apartment after the painting incident. Whitney says when she came home on the day Depp should have been filming a documentary with Keith Richards, she came home ""and the place was a mess.” She says the painting had been taken off the wall, and she noticed the signature of the painting had been altered. <br>Whitney also says ""it was apparent she [Heard] had been crying, her face was swollen. I noticed that one side of her face was super-red and she had a split lip."" <br>Ms. Laws tells Heard: ""Your sister has made the made mistake as you, saying you had a red face and swollen lip on the day you went to the filming of the Keith Richard's documentary."" <br>Ms. Laws says this is a description of an ""obvious and clear injury, which we can't see in any of the photographs."" <br>Ms. Laws goes on: ""You have quite a difficult path to tread because of all the lies you've woven. You've woven a web of lies which you've had to shift and change because of evidence that's come to light around this Keith Richards documentary."" <br>Heard disagrees.<br>We are now looking at a photo of the painting, which shows the altered signature, changed from ""Taysa van Ree"" to ""Taysa van Pee’ <br>We hear a text message exchange between Depp and Whitney, in which Whitney seeMs. to be cheering him on for defacing the image. <br>One reads: ""She' s the worst,” apparently referring to van Ree. <br>The judge asks if Heard has ""tried to construct an incident around these documents’ <br>Heard says no, ""It's a totally different painting, and I don't think Johnny realised that’ <br>Heard says Depp defaced multiple paintings, and ""the one he tried to light on fire was a canvas’  <br>Ms. Laws says ""multiple paintings"" is now ""another detail added’ <br>Heard says the number of paintings he destroyed was ""countless’ <br>For the fourth (fifth) time, Ms. Laws tells Heard she is ""making it up as she goes along’ <br>Heard says in the text exchange, which seeMs. to say she also found the image tampering ""funny,” it is because on that occasion ""you could wipe the mark off the glass’ She says Ms. Laws is mixing up two different painting incidents, one in 2012 and one in 2014. <br>Heard says: ""I didn't shift anything’</p>
<p>After a 10minute break, they went into the three day ""hostage situation"" Heard says she suffered at the hands of Depp in early March 2015. <br>Ms. Laws says Heard has alleged ""extreme acts of physical, emotional and psychological violence"" in her earlier violence. <br>Ms. Laws says she wants to find out exactly what physical violence took place.<br>A sentence in Heard's statement says: ""I fell like a rag doll.  I got back up and he said something like “You want to go? You want to fight, tough guy?” and he slapped me in the face."" <br>Another says: "" He grabbed me by the neck and shoved me against the fridge’ It goes on: ""Over the course of the day, he kept attacking me – he hit me, pushed me, choked me and spat in my face."" <br>Ms. Laws goes on to another extract which reads: ""I tried to run past him to get away and he grabbed me by the hair, hurled me around. I fell onto the ping pong table and it collapsed under me. He ended up on top of me."" <br>In Another part of the statement about the same incident, Heard says Depp ""ripped off my gown"" and later smashed her phone so hard ""It broke into pieces’ <br>Ms. Laws now moves on to an alleged incident on day two of the ""three day incident’ <br>In her statement Heard says: "" Glass was broken everywhere – on the floor and the counter-top. At some point he pulled me around by my neck and pushed me down against the bar, I was against the bar, naked, bent over backwards, my back against the marble. He was pressing so hard on my neck I couldn’t breathe. <br>A visibly and audibly upset Heard now tells the court: ""I was naked and my feet were bare, so I couldn't get a purchase on my feet... I was trying to push away from the counter top so I could breathe. I thought he had lost control of what he had done, I was slipping on the counter tops and slipping on the glass’ <br>Heard is crying a little as she says this. <br>In her statement Heard says she still has scars from the glass on her feet and arMs..</p>
<p>As the cross-examination moves to a photo taken of the injuries Heard alleges occurred on the trip, she wipes her nose with a tissue. <br>Heard says she took these photos herself in the bathroom. <br>Talking about the photos, Ms. Laws says: ""These are not scars sustained writhing around on the floor trying to get away from Mr Depp. They are straight."" <br>Heard says: ""I do not agree, I know they are’ <br>Ms. Laws suggests they are ""self-harm scars, inflicted by you’<br>Heard answers: ""I have had them since that night... I have never self-harmed. Johnny's a self-harmer, I'm not a self-harmer."" <br>Ms. Laws is now questioning Heard's comparison of the situation with being ""a hostage’ She says, ""You could have left at any time couldn't you?’ She goes on, ""And you had a cell phone didn't you - you could have called anyone at any point’ <br>Heard accepts she did have a phone, and could have called someone. <br>However Heard says she has not mis-characterised the situation, saying: ""Absolutely not. This was my marriage. I lived in it.”<br>Ms. Laws says the three days are a ""graphic depiction of the three day hostage situation,” and questions why Heard didn't record any of this at the time. <br>Heard says that Depp had ""taken eight to ten MDMA on the first night, maybe even more. There was no valuable conversation between us that would have been worth recording.""<br>Ms. Laws is asking about a phone call from Heard to her sister shortly after the Australia incident. <br>Ms. Laws asks why she did not tell her sister about what had happened. <br>Heard says: ""I can't remember what I said to her, but I certainly wouldn't have recalled everything that had happened to me.”<br>We are now talking about an audio recording, which appears to have been taken on Heard's phone but which she says Depp recorded. The audio is said to last ""seven or eight hours.” <br>Heard says ""years later"" she realised Depp had recorded it, and she only understood this once it ""came up in my divorce proceedings.” <br>Ms. Laws asks why this is not mentioned in her statements. <br>Ms. Heard says she can't mention everything. <br>Ms. Laws asks Heard when she discovered her phone after the recording had been taken. <br>Heard says it was the next day, as she ""had been given some drugs, and slept.” <br>Ms. Laws asked how Heard managed to call her sister if the phone was recording, and Heard says maybe on her iPad or through Facetime, but she ""has no recollection of that call.” <br>Ms. Laws asks Heard: ""You use your phone a lot and don't like to be away from your phone?"" <br>Heard answers: ""I wouldn't characterize myself that way.""<br>Ms. Laws is asking Heard if she ever listened to the long audio file on her phone. <br>Heard says: ""At some point, but maybe I just read transcripts, I can't remember.” <br>There is also apparently a second recording, taken several hours later. <br>The judge asks if Heard knows if it was her phone that recorded both. Heard says she doesn't know, ""But that was my suspicion.” <br>He then asks if she called her sister on her phone. <br>Heard says: ""I can't remember making that call.” <br>Heard asks the judge if she can ask a question. <br>The judge says: ""This is a one-way process , so it's not for you to ask questions to Ms. Laws.” He asks Ms. Laws to continue in her questioning.</p>
<p>Ms. Laws is asking where Heard spoke to her sister, and whether it was upstairs. <br>Again, Heard says she can't remember, but she says she did go upstairs at some point. <br>Ms. Laws is pushing the point that she wants to know why the phone has recorded a conversation with her sister, close by the phone, but she was not using the phone itself. <br>Heard says Jerry Judge (Depp's late head of security) was downstairs. <br>Ms. Laws asks why heard was not looking for her phone. <br>Heard answers: ""After everything I'd been through, strangled, hit, sexually assaulted, the last thing I was thinking about was where my cell phone was.”<br>Ms. Laws is asking Heard why she returned to a bedroom she claiMs. she had been assaulted in, to which the actress replies: ""It was not the room that was the problem.""  </p>
<p>Talk then returns to an allegation made yesterday in court by Heard, that Depp took her vintage Ford Mustang from her. <br>We move on to documentation over an MOT. However, at this point, the judge suggests it's a good place to end for the day.</p>
<p>Don’t even get me started on how ludicrous this testimony is or this update will be twice as long. Suffice it to say I’m outraged over the bullsh*t that got dropped by Amber Heard today.</p>
<p>More as I find it, folks.</p>","{'id': '224316765', 'petitionMedium': {'url': '//assets.change.org/photos/6/ji/qt/cCJIqTIqGdJenNr-800x450-noPad.jpg?1595346847', 'processing': False}}",,,,against
StarterPetitionUpdate,27335583,2020-07-20T15:43:03.000Z,,dc-entertainment-remove-amber-heard-from-aquaman-2,Amber Heard on the stand,"<p>This is a long one, folks.</p>
<p>We began the day with a van outside the court with a large display featuring Amber Heard with the caption: Ditch the Witch, and a lot of supporters for Johnny Depp.</p>
<p>Inside the court, things started off with few legal arguments back and forth about the allowance and review of some written submissions that were apparently put in at the last minute, doesn’t say what they are. The judge gave both parties until 1pm tomorrow to review and respond to them.</p>
<p>The defense also complained about Adam Waldman tweeting his “In memoriam” tweet from court and asked that AW be forced to desist from tweeting. DS called this a stunt, but the judge agreed that the phrase “In memoriam” is unwelcome because it might be misconstrued as a threat and left it there. AW wasn’t instructed not to tweet, as I understand it.</p>
<p>Amber Heard takes the stand wearing a short-sleeved light colored v-neck blouse with her hair braided over one shoulder. She confirms that her witness statement is true and correctly signed. Now that she’s been sworn in, her witness statement will be released to the public and we’ll be able to see what nonsense she’s come up with, including whatever she testifies to in private.</p>
<p>Out of the gate, Amber’s witness statement starts off painting her as the poor little victim to Johnny Depp’s “monster” getting brutalized, and woe is her, the poor little thing.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>She also insisted that he tried to control her professional life, reviewing her scripts and berating any romantic scenes she was in and insinuating that he told her what parts she could or couldn’t take based on whether or not there were nudity or romantic scenes. And she said that he began to say that she dressed like a whore and began to tell her what she could and couldn’t wear. She certainly did her homework about what real victims go through. Pity, though, that this is the first we’re hearing about all this, four years later. She even said that Johnny said that he hoped she’d get raped by “Slimy Mexicans” or a big gang of black MF-ers because of the sexy or revealing clothes she wore, accusing him not only of verbal abuse, but also of using racial slurs to do it with.</p>
<p>Mind you, this is all in her witness statement. She hasn’t begun to testify yet.</p>
<p>Out of the gate, Amber shows what a liar she is. Throughout her relationship with Johnny, she kept her house on Orange Ave, which means that she was never in danger of being homeless, like she claimed when trying to keep Johnny’s penthouse.</p>
<p>Also from the beginning, the female barrister isn’t having any of Amber’s showboating (which I almost misspelled as sow-boating, which would have been just as appropriate). Whenever Amber tried to add or embellish, FB yanked the chain and got the subject succinctly back on track.</p>
<p>FB’s first questions to Amber were about her family and friends that came to live in the Eastern Columbia building penthouses rent free.</p>
<p>Next, Amber admitted that she didn’t sign a prenup, nor was she asked to. But FB produced an email from David Kipper (a doctor) saying that Johnny and Amber had been fighting non-stop because he wanted a prenup. So she didn’t get five minutes in without contradicting herself with a lie. It also bears mention that Amber is so animated and agitated that the judge asked her to slow down with her answers.</p>
<p>They went back and forth about the prenup that never got signed, with Amber managing to get in that JD beat her up over it, of course. It’s rather hard to keep up with AH because she seemingly contradicts herself with every breath. There was no prenup, then there was. First Johnny wanted it, then it was his sister Cristy who wanted it, as well as a litany of his friends. But in the end, there WAS a prenup that simply never got signed.</p>
<p>She said at least twice that Johnny insisted that the only way out of the marriage was death. Implying, I supposed that he’d kill her before he’d let her go. Painting him as that monster again. Joke’s on her, innit? Because he did let her go.</p>
<p>Once again, the judge stops Amber from giving such lengthy answers that stray from the question. FB made this easier by asking a series of yes or no questions. Love her!</p>
<p>ML is FB asked about Amber’s statement that she didn’t take cocaine after the age of 18. Amber insisted that it was true, and that she didn’t take coke in front of Johnny, ever.</p>
<p>I swear, it’s almost impossible to keep up with Amber’s answers because she either contradicts herself so much, or she picks a fringe point to answer without addressing the direct question. Asked if she had coke issues, she says she never had anxiety eating disorders, which was mentioned, but wasn’t the point at all.</p>
<p>Amber insists that she never had anxiety eating disorder, is not bipolar, and never had a substance abuse problem. Dr Kipper, who wrote notes about all of the above, is either lying, got it wrong, or made a mistake. He’s the one, she says, that put her on such a range of meds that she’s lost track of them all.</p>
<p>ML nailed AH on taking drugs at Coachella, where Amber’s memory seems spotty about who she took MDMA and mushrooms with. First Amber said that she took them, but doesn’t remember who she took them with, then changed her story to say that she didn’t take them, and still doesn’t remember who she didn’t take them with. ML reminds her that it’s a high profile male she’s talking about, but Amber still feigns amnesia about it.</p>
<p>Amber then denies taking MDMA or mushrooms in Australia. She insists that she’s only done shrooms or MDMA (ecstasy) a handful of times, including Coachella and her bachelorette party. So Coachella’s back on the map. ML: So lots of medical professionals are either lying or misrepresenting Heard’s drug use? Amber blames it on Johnny, saying that HE misrepresented her drug use to all these people.</p>
<p>Amber denies being the one who puked in the parking lot at Coachella, insisting that she’s never barfed in a parking lot in her life. Instead, she blames the vomiting incident on her (then) pregnant sister. But a note/email to a friend says that Amber admitted to puking in the parking lot and being high for 24 hours. Amber tried to turn it around on Johnny, saying that he’s the one that did drugs, but ML (love her!) asked Amber to try to answer the question without making negative comments about her ex-husband. Amber had to agree to just answer the questions.</p>
<p>It bears noting that at every step of Amber’s testimony, netizens in the Twitterverse were posting screen grabs that directly contradict her. And a picture is worth a thousand words. If you haven’t followed Nick Wallis on Twitter, it’s worth looking him up, reading his spot-on live tweeting, and having a look at the comments. They tell the real story, unlike Amber.</p>
<p>Next, ML asked about Amber’s allegation that Johnny took her mustang away from her for 3.5 years, or longer, Amber added. She says he took the car and had his drivers take her everywhere so that he could keep tabs on where he was going. Maybe it’s just me, but I wouldn’t care if he knew where I was if I wasn’t doing something shady. There was some discussion at length about Johnny fixing the car up on the tv show Overhaulin in order to get out of paying for it and how Amber alleges that the car didn’t work right after the show – despite the plethora of photos she’s taken of herself driving “Cherry Thunder” as she’s dubbed it. How this has anything to do with the Sun calling Johnny a wife-beater is beyond me, but hey. What do I know?</p>
<p>They moved on to a matter of whether or not Samantha McMillen worked for, and was paid by, Amber Heard. Amber insists that SM never worked for her during a certain period, that she was only along as a “friend” or unpaid intern, but EL refers to a document where Amber admits to paying SM $1,300, complete with a photocopy of a check. To be honest, I don’t know what this has to do with the Sun, either, but it certainly does discredit Amber’s integrity as a witness, insisting that SM wasn’t her assistant, despite SM getting paid.</p>
<p>Amber was asked about her temper, and admitted that she had outbursts of rage during arguments with JD, but evidence was presented that Amber just has a bad temper in general, and has outbursts with more people than just Johnny Depp. Proven.</p>
<p>They played the tape where Amber admits to punching/hitting him, and admits to starting the fight. But Amber still insists that she was only reacting to Johnny’s violence towards her. Regarding the bathroom door incident, she says that she only pushed the door to keep Johnny from falling down, because, she says, he had a tendency to pass out drunk and vomit all over himself. Everyone who says she was the violent one, she says, is lying for Johnny. She only acted in self-defense.</p>
<p>After lunch, they stuck to the topic of Amber’s temper, which she said only got out of hand with Johnny, and only in response to his violence toward her. EL puts forth that that’s not true, and addresses Amber’s arrest for domestic violence against Tasya Van Ree in Washington in 2009. Amber insists that her relationship with Van Ree is the most peaceful relationship that she’s ever heard of, despite evidence of screaming matches and that arrest which Amber downplays as a non-event.</p>
<p>Moving on, EL talked about the day Amber went to court and the fact that there was so much press. EL asked if Amber tipped off the press. She said no and blamed the press being there on Johnny’s lawyers and TMZ – despite the fact that the TMZ article came out well before that. So, no dice there. She says that IF there was a leak of information, it didn’t come from her. It came from somebody else, either on behalf without her knowing, or that it was Johnny’s team. Anybody but her.</p>
<p>EL then questioned Amber as to why she wanted to meet with Johnny when the restraining order was in effect if she was so petrified of him. Amber gave some half-arsed statement about how she wasn’t afraid of Johnny, she was afraid of the monster.</p>
<p>Amber was then asked about the night of the fight where Amber says Johnny threw a phone at her face. Amber admits that Rocky Pennington, iO Tillet-Wright and Josh Drew were in the adjoining apartment. Not their own penthouses, as has been previously declared. She also admits that she called her lawyer and her publicist, as well as iO calling the police.</p>
<p>Every time She was caught lying by somebody else’s testimony and evidence, Amber was asked, “So are they lying?” She said she didn’t want to call anyone a liar, but then proceeded to call them a liar. She must have said that half a dozen times. Most of what they talked about has been said before, all about the night of that fateful fight and the aftermath. This accounting is long and rambling enough, so I’m not going to repeat it all. Suffice it to say that She says Johnny beat her up, hit her with a phone, and wrecked PH5 where she kept all her personal stuff, including her wardrobe. So, EL asked if the police officers were lying when they said they saw no damage to the property. Amber avoided giving a yes or no answer by saying things like “They must have seen it,” or “I don’t know how they could have missed it.”</p>
<p>At one point, EL said: “You’re making this up as you go along.” AH denied it, of course, but I LOVE EL for saying it.”</p>
<p>I also love that EL is showing pictures of the magical moving disappearing bruises and asking her to explain them, as well as whey they weren’t there the next day, and why people have testified that she had no marks on her at all. The answers are that the pictures were taken a different day, or she was wearing concealer, and everyone is lying.</p>
<p>And that was it for the day. And, unless somebody else steps up to live-tweet, that’s pretty much it for my timely updates. I’ve relied upon Nick Wallis’ brilliant live-tweeting for my updates, and he sadly won’t be able to do it anymore. So let’s all say thank you to Nick, and look forward to whatever updates might come our way.</p>","{'id': '224310705', 'petitionMedium': {'url': '//assets.change.org/photos/4/da/yv/GgDAYVbkVMexeDi-800x450-noPad.jpg?1595259787', 'processing': False}}",,,,against
StarterPetitionUpdate,27322204,2020-07-18T17:15:40.000Z,,dc-entertainment-remove-amber-heard-from-aquaman-2,Day 9,"<p>First up today was Isaac Baruch, an artist and friend of Johnny Depp’s since they were teens. Mr. Baruch resided in the Eastern Columbia building at the time of all these goings on. Right out of the gate, QC tries to twist his words and put words in his mouth that he didn’t say. When IB testified that he saw no marks or bruises on the night of the fight, QC began testifying to the opposite. IB asked if there was a question in there somewhere. Likewise, the judge stepped in to put a stop to it, too, to keep the proceedings on track and timely. The QC questions were pretty general, bantering back and forth about how IB has known JD so long, lives rent-free at Johnny’s residence, and might therefore lie out of loyalty. The same old song and dance. Until the Question of Elon musk arose, relating to when EM visited, which dates and what time of day. Usually late at night until morning, and always when Johnny was away. But just as fast as that came up, it was glossed over. So the make takeaway from IB is that on the night that Amber said Johnny threw a phone at her face, she bore no marks at all. None.</p>
<p>Alejandro Romero is a concierge at the ECB. He was also questioned about EM visiting, from around March of 2016. QC called him a liar about the dates because they don’t match up with her narrative, but AR stood his ground. And that was about it for him. Honestly, I’m not sure what this accomplished in relation to a case of Libel against the Sun for calling Johnny a wife-beater, but maybe it’ll get tied up later.</p>
<p>Travis McGivern works (worked?) as a security guard for Johnny Depp. QC made short work of browbeating him when he disagreed with her timetable of when he entered Johnny’s penthouse on the night of the that Amber Heard alleges that she only hit Johnny Depp in defense of her sister, Whitney Heard, and with whom. QC asserted that TM entered the apartment with Amber’s nurse, Debbie Lloyd when Amber was already in the apartment, with the fight already underway. TM says that he met Amber in the lobby and left DL there with her and went up to the penthouse alone. Amber came up after and got into it with Johnny. TM is adamant that Amber is the only one that was physically violent, punching Johnny in the head.  QC started testifying again, but TM kept in line asking for a question and refusing to speculate when she asked him to. The takeaway from this line of questioning is that somebody in the room can testify to the fact that only Amber Heard was violent that night.</p>
<p>Amanda De Cadanet, founder of the #MeToo movement and former Amber Heard supporter, will not be questioned. She has publicly withdrawn her support for Amber Heard, so this comes as no great surprise. The last thing the defense wants is another explosive testimony supporting Johnny Depp.</p>
<p>After lunch, there was some debate about metadata and how easily it can be forged, in reference to the May 16, 2016 pictures that Amber Heard had taken. The times in all of those photos, according to metadata, is 00:00, which is impossible if metadata is correct. The bickering started to interfere with the timetable of the proceedings, so it will be decided by Monday morning.</p>
<p>Laura Devinere is an interior decorator and on again/off again friend of Amber Heard’s. She was sworn in and confirms her witness statement. The basic gist of her testimony is that she was terrified into signing a statement in support of Johnny Depp due to coercion on the part of Adam Waldman. She says she’s terrified of what Johnny’s lawyers were insinuating they would do to her. She says she didn’t want to get involved and was very uncomfortable giving a statement.</p>
<p>An interesting note is that the court played a recording of a conversation between LD and Amber that was recorded without LD’s knowledge or consent, which is illegal in the state of California. How many laws does Amber have to break, FFS? In the conversation that was taped, Amber drilled LD about what AW was saying to her, and honestly, it sounds like LD is terrified of Amber Heard, not Adam Waldman.</p>
<p>The main takeaway from LD seems to be that she was uncomfortable making that statement that she never saw any injuries on Amber Heard because of pressure she was under from Johnny’s team, but nowhere does she say that the statement is untrue in any way. So, while she may still be terrified of Amber, LD stands by her statement.</p>
<p>Due to previous commitments, that’s all I caught. Apologies. But I hope you found this information useful.</p>
<p>I'm having internet issues, so if I don't get updates put up in a timely manner, kindly forgive.</p>","{'id': '224300958', 'petitionMedium': {'url': '//assets.change.org/photos/9/gd/ej/faGdeJsmEgHXgJN-800x450-noPad.jpg?1595092541', 'processing': False}}",,,,against
StarterPetitionUpdate,27304713,2020-07-16T17:06:37.000Z,,dc-entertainment-remove-amber-heard-from-aquaman-2,Day 8,"<p>The biggest takeaway from today is that Neither Vanessa Paradis nor Winona Ryder will be called to testify. They say it’s because there’s no need, as the allegations are that Johnny Depp hit Amber Heard, not them, so they won’t be called at all.</p>
<p>I’m not gonna lie. I was looking forward to seeing Vanessa take Queen’s Counsel (QC) apart stitch by stitch.</p>
<p>Sean Bett, a former LA county sheriff, worked for Johnny Depp in the 90’s as a security guard and as his driver. He’s the security guard that took pictures of Johnny Depp’s face after Amber Heard’s 30th birthday party, when she admittedly punched him in the face. He also helped search for Johnny Depp’s phone after Amber Heard threw it out of the apartment. QC tried to minimalize SB’s interaction with Johnny Depp and his family, so that it would somehow matter less when SB testified that he never saw injuries on Amber Heard. She flat out called SB a liar, but SB said that she could call him a liar a hundred times. It doesn’t change the facts. SB had no problem whatsoever asserting the facts, despite repeatedly having his statements challenged. QC said that they would have to agree to disagree.</p>
<p>I disagree. We’re not dealing with matters of opinion, here. It doesn’t matter what QC thinks, it matters what she can prove.</p>
<p>The judge stepping in when QC tried to insinuate that Johnny Depp, as well as SB, were involved in a nightclub incident where a woman says she was roughed up and handcuffed by Johnny Depp’s security, who tried to pass themselves off as police officers. Judge told QC to stop testifying and ask a question. Thank goodness! QC has a tendency to testify rather than posing a question.</p>
<p>While Winona Ryder and Vanessa Paradis will not be called on to testify, their witness statements were released and available to read online.</p>
<p>They’re running behind, so Amber Heard will not take the stand tomorrow. She’ll have the whole weekend to best figure out how to spin some damage control, if she doesn’t spend the time clubbing or shopping.</p>
<p>There isn’t a schedule yet as to who will appear next, or when, but here’s a suggested list of who might take the stand tomorrow. Isaac Baruch, artist and friend of Johnny Depp. Travis McGivern, Building manager at the Eastern Columbia Building. And Katherine Kendall, an actor and #metoo advocate.</p>
<p>On a personal note, it’s been suggested that I take these updates too personally. Yes, I do, especially when a woman’s survival of rape is stolen and twisted by a narcissistic sociopath to read like it’s her own story, I do take it very personally. As a survivor, a woman, and as a human being. And I will NOT apologize for that.</p>

StarterPetitionUpdate,27298052,2020-07-15T23:07:14.000Z,,dc-entertainment-remove-amber-heard-from-aquaman-2,Amber Heard's new Low,"<p>I have to admit that I was a little late to the game today. I did finally catch up and read all the tremendous live tweets from Nick Wallis. And I started to write a blow-by-blow series of events like I did yesterday, but there was one thing that happened today that I just can’t get past.</p>
<p>Kate James (KJ) was Amber Heard’s personal assistant. As such, Amber heard about a horrific incident that had happened in Kate’s life. When she was 26, Kate was raped at machete point for hours and barely escaped with her life.</p>
<p>And now, we find out that Amber Heard has taken <a href=""https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Ec--4AqWoAEHkqm?format=jpg&amp;name=medium"" rel=""nofollow"">that story</a> and twisted it around as if it’s her own story.</p>
<p>I could go on and on about how this is textbook behavior for a narcissistic sociopath, but frankly, I’m too disgusted to look up the references. They’re out there if you want to look ‘em up yourself.</p>
<p>This perverted, despicable action is reportedly described in Amber Heard’s witness statement, to which we can’t be privy until after she’s been sworn in. So we’ll have to wait and see how similar Amber’s story is to Kates.</p>
<p>On a personal note, I can’t begin to describe how vile it is for Amber to take the single worst moment of a person’s life and use it for her own personal gain. What gain? I can only speculate that she’s going to accuse Johnny of being the one that raped her. I knew she was going to pull something for sympathy when she hit the stand, but I didn’t know that it would be this repugnant. Not only to potentially lie about Johnny raping her, but also to steal someone’s real life story to do it. As a survivor myself, I am deeply appalled and offended on every level.</p>
<p>Amber Heard is supposed to take the stand on Friday, if everything stays remotely on schedule. We’ll see then how low Amber has sunk in her crusade to vilify Johnny Depp. And how severely she’ll test my gag reflex.</p>

StarterPetitionUpdate,27285707,2020-07-14T17:09:04.000Z,,dc-entertainment-remove-amber-heard-from-aquaman-2,Poopgate Pictures,"<p>Malcolm Connolly was a security person for Johnny Depp and Amber Heard. He was asked about several instances including the time on the honeymoon train, citing journal entries that accuse Johnny of beating her up, and never mind the fact that, yet again, she doesn’t have a mark on her. He, on the other hand, is sporting <a href=""https://buckwriter.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/12974294_539598889547092_1989485723801669839_n.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">a huge shiner</a>. Oh his honeymoom.</p>
<p>Moving on to the topic of Australia, QC tried to insinuate that, because of all the different stories that came out, that Amber didn’t chop off Johnny’s finger at all. Maybe Johnny did it himself on that accordion door, which Malcolm insisted is impossible because the door has a safety feature.</p>
<p>Queen’s Counsel, (QC) also insinuated that Johnny injured Amber despite the fact that she was searing a slip when Malcolm arrived first, and she didn’t have a mark on her. Scratches on her arms didn’t appear until after Jerry Judge, Johnny’s long-time head of security, showed up. In other words, those scratches were more likely than not self-inflicted.</p>
<p>When QC’s insinuations didn’t sway Malcolm to change his answers, she made it seem that Johnny was on drugs, as usual.</p>
<p>Redirect clarified that Malcolm simply never saw any injuries on Amber Heard. He, Malcolm, wouldn’t tolerate any man hitting a woman. Not Johnny Depp. Not even the Pope. On the other hand, Malcolm recounts being asked to intervene because Amber heard kept hitting Johnny repeatedly. Malcolm also assures the court that he has not been pressured in any way into testifying on Johnny Depp’s behalf.</p>
<p>Tara Roberts, (TR) is Johnny Depp’s Bahamian estate manager. QC started by insinuating that TR relies upon JD for her home and income, so she’d lie for him. TR insists that she’s got other family income. She’d be sad if she lost the job because of all the friends she’s made, but that she wouldn’t be financially devastated. She’s got no reason to lie to keep her job, and wouldn’t anyway.</p>
<p>QC tried to debunk TR’s statement that Johnny has never been violent toward people by showing that TMZ video. TR wouldn’t change her statement that Johnny isn’t violent or that Amber had no injuries on the island. So, unable to make any headway with her, QC let her off the hook.</p>
<p>Redirect cleared up that TR never saw Johnny hit or abuse Amber Heard or any other person. And that Amber never showed any injuries. But she did see Amber Heard being violent toward Johnny Depp, causing injuries including a gash across the bridge of his nose.</p>
<p>No further questions.</p>
<p>Samantha MCmillen (SM) is Johnny Depp’s stylist since 2002, for 18 years now. She also worked as a stylist for Amber Heard while she and Johnny were together. SM confirmed what she’s been saying the whole time that when Amber Heard appeared on <a href=""https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2020/07/14/17/depp-court.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">the James Cordon show</a>, she displayed no injuries despite insisting that she had two black eyes.</p>
<p>Hilda Vargas (HV) has been Johnny Depp’s housekeeper for 30 years. She’s the one that found poop in Johnny Depp’s bed. QC tried to blame it on the dogs by saying that Depp’s dog Boo has a history of having accidents. HV clarified that the dogs have accidents “On the floor.” Both Pistol and Boo are too small to jump on the bed, and have never had an accident in the bed. She’s cleaned up after Boo many times, so she can say with authority that the poops were too big to have come from him. QC tried to suggest that Amber Heard was already gone for a full day at Coachella before the poop happened, but HV stuck to her story that Johnny was gone, and the poop was fresh. QC says that HV was angry, and HV admits that she felt disrespected to be left a mess like that because this sort of thing hasn’t happened 30 years of Working for Johnny Depp.</p>
<p>Redirect clarified HV’s statements, and included that HV also saw Amber in May of 2016 without any injuries on her.</p>

StarterPetitionUpdate,27254148,2020-07-10T18:04:46.000Z,,dc-entertainment-remove-amber-heard-from-aquaman-2,Johnny Depp in Court: Day 4,"<p>Johnny seemed very confident today even though QC badgered him and called him a liar with every other breath and brought his dying mother into it. Really low blow.</p>
<p>QC tried to paint Johnny as a drug-addicted monster that walks around in a rage all the time. She failed miserably, because quite simply, that isn’t true.</p>
<p>QC went into that final night, the one where Amber insists that Johnny threw a cell phone at her face.</p>
<p>I’d like to interject here that if you haven’t seen Brian’s videos, be sure to check him out. He debunks her version of events with clear and concise logic that’s infallible. You can find him <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCg0C-N_MPYYOXyF4T3jMxNQ/videos"" rel=""nofollow"">HERE</a>.</p>
<p>They brought up our little petition in court today. It had been suggested that he had something to do with creating the petition back when Amber Heard was in AM1. Johnny said that the petition came “years later.” So take heart in knowing that he’s aware of us, my friends.</p>
<p>After a 5 (or so) session where testimony was given in chambers, David Sherborne (DS) redirected Johnny for an hour before the lunch break and an hour afterward.</p>
<p>DS asked about the people Johnny surrounds himself with. QC had painted them as yes men who wouldn’t interfere while He was slapping his wife around. DS gave Johnny a chance to testify that such is not true. His entourage wouldn’t stand idly by while such a thing happened, which was never a problem because it never happened.</p>
<p>The main difference between QC’s cross examination and DS’s redirect is that DS asked questions in a brief and concise manner. And he allowed Johnny to complete his answers instead of cutting him off, which QC did almost constantly. It was a very efficient way of conducting business. In two hours, DS debunked the accusations about Johnny’s violent nature that QC spent 3.5 days trying to construct.</p>
<p>Also debunked were the accusations that Johnny acquired massive amounts of drugs for only himself. Amber Heard’s medical records of the time showed that she had, indeed, ingested or otherwise used (abused?) drugs, including some that Johnny doesn’t even use.</p>
<p>After Johnny was let out of the hot seat, officer Melissa Saenz testified via video uplink. This is one of the officers that responded the night of that last, final fight of the marriage, the one where Amber insisted that Johnny threw a phone at her face and otherwise roughed her up.</p>
<p>QC tried to insist that OMS didn’t get a very good look at Amber’s face, and that there were injuries to Amber’s face that OMS missed, or didn’t see, or whatever. But OMS remained completely certain that she did get a very good look at Amber, and that there were no marks. There were no signs of violence whatsoever, on Amber or at the scene.</p>
<p>Like she did with Johnny, QC pulled the tactic of calling OMS a liar and interjecting her own scenario. But OMS weathered it brilliantly and refused to change her account of the evening.</p>
<p>I’m not sure what QC thought she was going to get away with, trying to call OMS a liar. OMS is a trained professional, an expert in domestic violence. But all she succeeded in doing was making herself look foolish.</p>
<p>That’s about all I caught from today. More as I hear about it.</p>
<p>On a personal note, I simply don’t see how Johnny can’t come out on top. Where the defense had nothing but “suggestions” and self-imposed testimony, the offense – Johnny’s team – has receipts for everything. Medical records and whatever else they need to prove their side of the case. I think it’s a slam dunk.</p>
<p>Next up: Probably updates about how Amber Heard is out until late/early every morning partying it up, seeming to take none of this seriously. And never mind Covid 19 in the crowds.</p>

StarterPetitionUpdate,27243789,2020-07-09T17:14:10.000Z,,dc-entertainment-remove-amber-heard-from-aquaman-2,Johnny Depp in court: Day Three,"<p>Day three saw more of the same badgering from the Sun’s counsel, who I’ll refer to as QC. Today, she addressed two incidents of what she called violence against Amber Heard at the hands of Johnny Depp.</p>
<p>First, QC talked about what happened in Australia when Johnny lost the tip of his finger. QC badgered Johnny with Amber’s ever-changing version of events. Now, Amber’s saying that she slept through the night and morning when Johnny chopped off his own finger and trashed the house – though she did make a statement in documents that she’s the one that broke the TV, belying her story that she woke up in the morning to find all this horror.</p>
<p>Johnny held his own, though, giving answers that were at times humorous and I daresay sassy. It was refreshing to see that he adamantly refuses to let Amber’s team get away with her fictional version of events.</p>
<p>It was rather horrifying, though, to see Johnny describe how the bone was sticking out of his devastated finger, and being so ruined himself that he did indeed write on the walls and mirrors in his own blood.</p>
<p>The judge and Johnny’s counsel were heard from a lot more today, objecting when QC stepped out of line, giving Johnny more of a chance to answer questions without being interrupted. Not that there were many questions. It was more like QC giving testimony and interrupting Johnny when he tried to answer to the fictional charges she was laying out.</p>
<p>QC also described the incident in the penthouse where Amber Heard said she hit Johnny for the first (and only?) time, in defense of her sister Whitney. Amber insists that Johnny was pushing Whitney around to try to get at Amber to abuse her. Johnny patently denied that version of events the same way he denies her version of all of these events.</p>
<p>As court wrapped up, it became known that Johnny’s lawyer will have an hour to redirect – to question Johnny again about certain points that QC addressed during her cross examination. I think that’s good. After being raked over the coals for three days, Johnny will get a chance to set the record straight.</p>
<p>On another amusing note, it seems that our little petition has been mentioned in court documents. See <a href=""https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EcerdEtWoAECbP0?format=jpg&amp;name=900x900"" rel=""nofollow"">the picture</a>. It seems that Amber Heard is bugged by our efforts. And to that, I say: GOOD. She needs to know that actions have consequences, and it’s not always consequences you can control. She seems to be the type that likes to be in control, but she can’t control the petition, and she will never control me.</p>
<p>That’s about it for today. I’ll update as fast as I find out.</p>","{'id': '224244106', 'petitionMedium': {'url': '//assets.change.org/photos/6/ge/ke/ISgekeKrppUcXrq-800x450-noPad.jpg?1594314854', 'processing': False}}",,,,against

<p>But Johnny's having none of it. He won't admit to it because he never did it. He's never been violent with women and he's never been violent with Amber Heard.</p>
<p>The sun's counsel is leaning heavily on a fight on a plane wherein Amber Heard says that Johnny Kicked her, trying to get Johnny to say that if a man would kick a woman, doesn't that make him a wife-beater. Johnny's staying on top of it though, insisting that it didn't happen. And I guess Amber forgets that they weren't alone on the plane. There was a pilot, a stewardess, and two assistants. If any such kick took place, I'm sure it would have been in the headlines at the time.</p>
<p>Basically, the Sun's outta gas.</p>
<p>By the end of the day, the Sun was asking for more time to put Johnny on the stand, because, as she says, Johnny took too long answering questions and put her behind. It's a sneaky way of keeping Johnny in the hot seat and creating less time for the Sun and/or Amber Heard to have to explain themselves. I hope the judge sees right through it. </p>
<p>Both parties have tomorrow to bicker about it, then the judge will make a ruling on how much extra time, if any, Johnny is on the stand again on Friday.</p>

Johnny’s legal team tried to have her banned until or unless such a time as she might be called on to testify herself, but that bid was lost. That means that she can and likely will sit there watching Johnny Depp testify about why he’s not a wife-beater, and the Sun tabloid is guilty of libel by calling him such.</p>
<p>The case is planned to be heard in a UK court on Tuesday. NGN’s legal team failed to get the case thrown out of court earlier this week.</p>
<p>In UK criminal cases, witnesses cannot be present in court while others testify. However, they can be present in civil cases. Depp hoped to ban Heard by claiming her testimony would be influenced if she was present while he was cross-examined.</p>
<p>In a court order published today, Justice Nicol rejected that argument.</p>
<p>This is a classic abuser’s intimidation tactic, to stare down the victim as they testify, hoping to frighten or otherwise affect Johnny’s testimony. Maybe she thinks that he’ll see her baby greens and melt.</p>
<p>Me, I hope the judge sees this attempt at manipulation for what it is and calls her on it if she so much as blinks wrong at Johnny. It won’t make a difference in the Sun libel case, but any shenanigans she pulls can be carried directly to Depp’s defamation case in January, 2021.</p>

<p>Every time we make the news, there’s a chance that somebody new might read the petition and realize what Johnny Depp really went through at the hands of Amber Heard. It’s important for him to be vindicated, but it’s also important in the broader sense that men can be the victims of not only abuse, but the unsubstantiated accusations of some spiteful abuser that wants to ruin him. Any man can fall victim to it. Anybody can.</p>
<p>Most recently, a guy called <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=1&amp;v=rYTVB52-Pok&amp;feature=emb_title"" rel=""nofollow"">ENTERTAINMENT HACKER</a> made a video about us, and he explains beautifully how the petition can help raise awareness. It’s worth a look.</p>
<p>So, you see, it’s a cycle. The petition raises awareness, and the press reports on us, raising awareness about us so we can raise even more awareness about the issue.</p>
<p>Thank you to everybody who shares this petition, whether it’s through the media, or one person sharing the link. Each and every one of you is helping bring justice for Johnny, and raise awareness of a very important issue whose time has come.</p>

Amanda says that she feels “used” and “misled” by Amber Heard after hearing heard abuse ex Johnny Depp in audio tapes.</p>
<p>Amber Heard was expecting the long-time women’s rights activist to testify on her behalf Johnny Depp’s upcoming libel suit against the UK tabloid the Sun, which starts in just 12 days, and in Depp’s looming defamation suit against Amber Heard herself. Now, that’s not going to happen.</p>
<p>It remains unclear whether or not De Cadenet will testify on behalf of Johnny Depp.</p>
<p>If you recall, Amanda De Cadenet (center) was pictured with a smiling and bruise-free Amber Heard just hours after she (Heard) claimed that she was brutally attacked. But said nothing.</p>
<p>And those tapes were released in January 2020, six months ago, but De Cadenet said nothing. Still, the fact that one of Heard’s staunchest supporters and a leader in the #MeToo movement has withdrawn support for Heard is a HUGE development. The closer the court dates get, the more rats jump off of Heard’s sinking ship.</p>
<p>Who do you think will jump off next? iO? Rocky? Rocketman? Who else has she got left?</p>

<p>There had been previous rumors that Heard and Delevingne were having an affair before and during the time of Depp and Heard’s divorce, but this is the first mention of a three-way with Heard, the supermodel and the billionaire.</p>

But Heard’s fate has yet to be officially confirmed in a court of law.</p>
<p>For L’Oréal, though, Heard’s innocence or guilt shouldn't really be the issue. The suspicion should have been enough. After all, if a man were accused of half the things Amber Heard has done, he would have been sacked on the spot. The fact that Amber Heard continues to be a spokesperson for L’Oréal can only mean that the brand condones domestic violence and abusers. They are firmly in their corner.</p>
<p>A responsible company that cares about the rights of abused people would have immediately distanced themselves from Heard. At the least, they would have withdrawn her images from public circulation whilst they awaited the outcome of the trial.</p>
<p>Instead, L’Oréal has done exactly the opposite, posting images of Amber Heard over the weekend, praising her for her inner strength and beauty. To add insult to injury, the very next image they posted was a pair of pink boxing gloves, further teasing at their support of violent behavior.</p>
<p>The outrage on Twitter was immediate and definite. It’s a slap in the face to all domestic violence survivors, and quite a few people didn’t hesitate to say so.</p>

<p>If L’Oréal continues to endorse a known abuser, they will find themselves on the wrong side of history. There’s no telling what damage they stand to suffer. For a beauty company, it certainly won’t be pretty. And they will have only themselves to blame.</p>

<p>What’s really interesting about this conversation, though, is that Amber Heard recorded it without Laura’s knowledge or consent (see photo).

That’s pretty huge, as it shows Ms. Heard’s disregard for the law.</p>
<p>Court has also ruled that Heard’s former PA can testify. Mr. Justice Nicol declared that some, limited testimony from Kate James, a former personal assistant to Heard, will be included in the forthcoming trial. Specifically, Kate never saw any bodily injuries on Amber Heard’s body or face.</p>
<p>Likewise, Mr. Justice Nicol will admit testimony from Vanessa Paradis, Johnny Depp’s partner of 14 years and the mother of his two children. Vanessa has written letters of support for Johnny and has been vocal about the fact that Johnny is kind and gentle, and has never been abusive toward her</p>
<p>Winona Ryder’s, Johnny’s past girlfriend, will also testify that Johnny was never abusive towards her in any way. In her statement, Ryder said: “I cannot wrap my head around [Heard’s] accusations. He was never, never violent towards me. He [Depp] was never, never abusive at all towards me.”</p>
<p>Heard was not happy about the ruling. A spokeswoman for Heard said: “As the judgment today shows, Mr. Depp’s team has been attempting to introduce irrelevant evidence. This is one of the defining characteristics of their strategy – to adduce irrelevant evidence designed to smear Ms. Heard and distract from the facts so that people do not focus on Mr. Depp’s behaviour.”</p>
<p>In other words, she’s all butthurt that his past girlfriends get to say what a nice guy he is.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, testimony from David Killackey, Johnny Depp’s mechanic, was ruled irrelevant and will not be admitted. If you remember, Killackey was witness to threats from both Amber Heard and her father, as well as being sexually harassed by Heard herself.</p>
<p>We need to keep in mind that this is ONLY Johnny’s libel case against the Sun. ONLY about whether Johnny was abusive toward Amber Heard, not about her being abusive to him. Evidence that may be irrelevant to the libel case in the UK will probably be admissible in Johnny’s Defamation case in VA. We’ll most likely heard from Mr. Killackey then.</p>

<p>Lately, Amber Heard’s team has been accusing Johnny of abusing his past girlfriends, trying desperately to establish a pattern of abuse by Johnny.</p>
<p>That’s blown up in her face repeatedly, because those past girlfriends have shown up every time <a href=""https://www.thedailybeast.com/winona-ryder-and-vanessa-paradis-defend-johnny-depp-he-was-never-never-violent"" rel=""nofollow"">to defend him</a>, saying that he’s a kind and gentle and was never violent with them.</p>
<p>Amber heard, on the other hand, has a long and storied history of showing violent tendencies with multiple people. She was arrested in 2009 and 9 for <a href=""https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2016/06/07/amber-heard-arrested-2009-charge-hitting-girlfriend/85563338/"" rel=""nofollow"">assaulting her wife</a> Tasya Van Ree. Stories are still coming out about other women stepping forward to say that she also abused them.</p>
<p>Fast forward to the present and Amber’s current trials and tribulations. The stories about injuries she reportedly inflicted upon Johnny Depp – in her own words caught on tape – have been pretty well documented. I’m not here to recount all of them. I’d be here all day. Suffice it to say that she tortured him and nearly killed him on several occasions.</p>
<p>It does bear mentioning that it's not just Johnny that was affected by Heard's actions. His children were often in the house during these incidents and witnessed the immediate aftermath.</p>
<p>And there have been other victims of Amber’s wrath. Kate James, Heard’s former personal assistant, has come forward with horrifying and heartbreaking stories <a href=""https://theblast.com/c/johnny-depp-amber-heard-abuse-assistant-kate-james-lawsuit-drugs-mental-verbal-trial"" rel=""nofollow"">of the way she was treated</a> at Amber Heard’s hands.</p>
<p>”Amber was regularly verbally and mentally abusive and would often scream at me in that way, over the smallest things. She would fly into blind rages where no-one could reason with her, and even if I was trying to offer an explanation, I didn’t think that she could hear me as she was so angry. It was like she thought regular things that can go wrong in any person’s life on any given day didn’t apply to her. Everything that went wrong was always my fault. I remember one occasion where she missed a connection on a flight on or around Christmas Day in 2012. My aunt was visiting from Australia at that time. She was screaming abuse at me for literally hours as though I had made it snow and caused the disruptions to the flight.”</p>
<p>One time, Amber Heard took James’ <a href=""https://twitter.com/winonasrider/status/1237872412080795649?lang=en"" rel=""nofollow"">4 year old son</a> to use as a human prop in a photo shoot. If I recall correctly, Heard drove with the tiny toddler in the front seat without any restraint. Jame’s was horrified and couldn’t get her son away from Heard fast enough.</p>
<p>Then there’s <a href=""https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7743993/Amber-Heards-father-threatened-SHOOT-Johnny-Depp-witness-testifies-actors-defamation-suit.html"" rel=""nofollow"">David Killackey</a>, who was reportedly threatened and sexually harassed by Amber Heard. David, who worked on both Heard and Depp's classic cars, claimed that Heard was abusive toward him and that her father, David Heard, made 'death threats' toward Depp in a phone call. Killackey said the abuse began after he told Heard that all work on the cars would have to be paid directly, rather than through Depp's management. “The reply I received was to verbally abuse me with expletives, threats and a continued rant over what she claimed was an unfortunate financial downturn of her personal finances caused by Mr. Depp. At one point she said ""you motherf***er, you're screwing me!""</p>
<p>Another time, Heard asked Killackey to show her something in her car. Then, when they were both inside, Heard said suggestively that they were alone down there and that “anything could happen.” Killackey immediately exited the vehicle, spurning her advances, and that she became unpleasant after that.</p>
<p>Killackey said that he stopped communicating with Heard directly after a 'very unpleasant' call, and soon began to hear from her father instead. During one phone call about the repairs, David Heard allegedly told Killackey: 'That f***ing piece of s*** is f***ing me too because I'm supposed to get 10 percent of the money and without it I can't produce the movie I was gunna make!” David Heard went on to say: 'When I get to him I'm going to beat the s*** out of him' and 'I'm from Texas, and men from Texas carry 45's and Johnny is going to meet the f***ing end of mine!' Killackey claimed.  </p>
<p>Killackey reported the threats to the police.</p>
<p>Apparently, that apple didn’t fall far from the tree.</p>
<p>The point, here, is that it’s Amber Heard is the one that has a history of abusive behavior, not Johnny Depp. No matter how much smoke and mirrors she throws up to make it look like Johnny is the one who was violent, there is simply no getting away from the history of her own actions. And, soon enough, she’ll end up paying for them. He tacky little web is falling apart around her, and she’s got nowhere left to hide.</p>
<p>I, for one, can’t wait to see her finally meet her Karma. I only wish I could have a front row seat.</p>","{'id': '223770448', 'petitionMedium': {'url': '//assets.change.org/photos/1/aj/sp/khaJsPnDNHPfNpr-800x450-noPad.jpg?1589538998', 'processing': False}}",,,,against
StarterPetitionUpdate,26603653,2020-05-10T23:53:54.000Z,,dc-entertainment-remove-amber-heard-from-aquaman-2,"""Official"" confirmation. Will we get it?","<p>We would all love to see official confirmation that Amber Heard has been fired. But when it comes to the entertainment industry, it’s not always that cut and dried.</p>
<p>Everybody in Hollywood might know for a fact that she won’t be returning as Mera in Aquaman 2. She might already know it herself. So could we. We could know that she’s already been dealt out of the movie and blacklisted from the DC universe, and blackballed in Hollywood, but might be waiting for “official” confirmation before we let ourselves believe it.</p>
<p>But that’s not always the way it goes in Hollywood. We might never get “official” confirmation. It’s entirely possible that the only confirmation we actually get is when they film and release the film without her in it.</p>
<p>I hear some Amber Stan in the back screaming: “But she has a contract! You’re stupid!” And that maybe true, on both counts. But consider this. Actors can be bought out of their contracts the same way athletes can, and for a variety of reasons. Remember when Robert Downey Junior couldn’t be insured because of his drug use? Didn’t the same thing happen to Linsey Lohan? That could be why. Or there could be a heinous breach of the contract’s morals clause. Could be she was just a nightmare to work with and they were looking for a reason to dump her.</p>
<p>It could be anything.</p>
<p>RDJ was able to regroup and make the world's best comeback, thanks to the friends he has in the industry, and I'm glad.</p>
<p>Whatever the reason, there’s every reason to believe that Amber Heard won’t be back in Aquaman 2. I don’t know if they’ll replace her as Mera, or if they’ll just write the character out and get Momoa a new love interest. Either way, the movie will be better for it. I, personally, look forward to enjoying it without her in it.</p>
<p>The moral of the story is a lot of fans already believe that Amber Heard is out. You may not, and that’s fine. But don’t hold your breath for “official” confirmation. It may not come. But when AM2 comes out without her, we’ll all be celebrating just the same.</p>

StarterPetitionUpdate,26595397,2020-05-09T19:20:43.000Z,,dc-entertainment-remove-amber-heard-from-aquaman-2,That reporter from the Times,"<p>A few days ago, I was contacted by a journalist from the NYTimes, asking me about the petition. I was dumb and naïve, and I responded to her questions.</p>
<p>The reporter’s name is Rachel Abrams. In addition to the Times, she’s written pieces for Variety and other publications that favor Amber and Elon Musk, as well as others. I didn’t know that when I talked to her. I thought I was helping to get the petition some attention with a piece in the New York Times. I’m sure she was counting on that. And, sadly, she got it.</p>
<p>She asked me about why I started the petition. I told her that I started the petition because I was sick of the inequality in Hollywood. If a man were accused of half the things that Amber reportedly did, he would have been sacked on the spot. And, in fact, he was. Johnny got canned because of Amber’s WaPo op-ed.</p>
<p>She asked me if any famous names have signed. I said that I saw the name Nic Cage scroll by, but that there’s no way of knowing if that was the real Nicolas Cage showing support for his friend or if somebody was just using that name. No way to tell.</p>
<p>She asked for a list of people who have signed this petition, but don’t worry, kids. She did not get it. Under no circumstances would I serve you guys up that way. You’re safe with me.</p>
<p>She asked if I've talked to Adam Waldman. I told her that I have not.</p>
<p>She asked where I got my information for my updates, and I named several sources, like the Blast. I’m sorry to say that I also named Brian McPherson, <a href=""https://twitter.com/ThatBrianFella"" rel=""nofollow"">ThatBrianFella</a> on Twitter and <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCg0C-N_MPYYOXyF4T3jMxNQ"" rel=""nofollow"">Incredibly Average</a> on Youtube. He truly is the best source for information, the way he scours every source available and reports on it objectively. I stressed that several times, his objectivity. It’s easy to lean in Johnny Depp’s favor when all the shady stuff is on Amber’s side, but Brian sticks to objectivity. That’s what makes him such a reliable source.</p>
<p>I was an idiot. I chatted away, thinking everything was on the up and up. And I hope they were. But there’s the very real possibility that I was just fodder for a hit piece she and her team are working on to make Johnny Depp and his fans look stupid, and I walked right into it.</p>
<p>Watch for her piece, folks. Only time will tell what spin she had in mind when she got me on the phone.</p>
<p>If she was legitimately interested in the petition, as she seemed, I hope she writes a piece that brings some attention to the inequality of cause and effect within Hollywood.</p>
<p>If, on the other hand, her intentions were duplicitous and I was played for a fool, I can only hope that I am kindly forgiven by the wonderful folks within the Depp community for being so naive. I intended only good.</p>
<p>We’ll have to wait and see.</p>","{'id': '223736257', 'petitionMedium': {'url': '//assets.change.org/photos/8/py/co/mwPYCOpVTuashGM-800x450-noPad.jpg?1589052045', 'processing': False}}",,,,against

StarterPetitionUpdate,26568574,2020-05-06T19:30:09.000Z,,dc-entertainment-remove-amber-heard-from-aquaman-2,Elon Musk melts down on Twitter.,"<p>Following the birth of his latest son - I'd provide his name, but frankly, I can't understand it - Elon musk jumped on twitter to criticize UK coronavirus advisor Neil Ferguson, who just stepped down from his government post after getting caught breaking quarantine rules for a tryst with a married woman.</p>
<p>""What a tool,"" Musk wrote while retweeting an article about Ferguson's public indiscretion.</p>
<p>Depp fans were quick to point out Musk's indiscretions with Amber Heard just one month after she married Johnny Depp. </p>
<p>Musk adamantly denies he was involved in any love triangle, and reaffirmed his stance on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Of the images released of video footage showing Musk in the elevator going up to Depp's penthouse with Heard, Musk said: ""This is false. JD’s team put out 'video evidence', but conveniently excluded the date stamp, as it was well after JD &amp; AH had separated.""</p>
<p>A die-hard Johnny Depp fan continued to lay into Musk and did not let him off the hook for the denial.</p>
<p>""The building staff testified under oath they let you in the building while Johnny was filming in Australia. Amber asked them to get you a fob so you had freedom to come and go. Security saw you multiple times while they were married,"" the person wrote to Musk.</p>
<p>Musk once again claimed that whoever gave a deposition was not telling the truth, and wrote:</p>
<p>""This person is wrong. Why does JD want to believe he got cucked so bad anyway!?""</p>
<p>“Cuck” is a concept borne out of insecurity: a fear that one is inadequate, sexually or otherwise, and that inadequacy will lead to the loss of the things that are important to him. ... Those who call others a cuck do so in the desperate hope that shreds of their own masculine and racial prominence can be protected.</p>
<p>So Elon Musk is taking pot shots at Johnny's masculinity, saying Johnny wasn't enough of a man for Amber, and that he himself was. The use of that word speaks volumes about Musk's own insecurities, though, rather than his intended insult toward Depp.</p>
<p>Johnny Depp isn't ""Cucked."" He's more than adequate as a man and as a human being. Otherwise, he wouldn't be such a target for a toxic narcissist who tried to take advantage of him, ruin him, and possibly even kill him. </p>
<p>Seems to me that Musk should have better things to do with his time these days, like basking in the glory of being a new father.</p>
<p>But that's just me.</p>

Listen to 911 call made the night Johnny Depp and Amber Heard had blowout fight that ended their toxic 18-month marriage - but both claim tape backs up their version of events.</p>
<p>'Hi, I need to report an assault right now happening at 849 Broadway at the Eastern building,' the caller says, referring to the couple's home in LA. The recording was buried in legal files for nearly four years and it raises tantalizing new questions about the former couple's infamous clash around the time. Timestamped 8:27pm on May 21, 2016, the call appears to have been made when Heard claims Depp hurled a cell phone at her face and tore out her hair.</p>
<p>Refusing to give a name, the caller explains that a friend named Amber is being attacked by a man described merely as a 'boyfriend', saying: 'I happen to know that it's happening and I just need to remain anonymous. Physically assaulting her, yeah,' replies the caller, becoming agitated. 'Send somebody up there please,' the caller adds, reiterating the location of the couple's lavish penthouse before the recording abruptly ends. </p>
<p>Heard's attorney says phone records and police department logs vindicate Heard’s account of the final shocking episode of domestic violence she endured before filing for divorce.</p>
<p>Depp’s legal team say this recording does the precise opposite, however, by raising discrepancies in the various accounts Heard and her allies have given of the notorious dust up.  </p>
<p>His attorney is also questioning the identity of the caller, pointing out the female voice on the clip does not belong to iO Tillett Wright. They suggest the 8:27pm 911 call was instead placed by Heard's buddy Raquel Pennington.</p>
<p>iO Tillett Wright's famous call was not registered on the 911 system until 10:09pm, around an hour and a half after the alleged attack. Johnny's team insists that the timing discrepancies support his version of events that night.</p>

StarterPetitionUpdate,26274852,2020-04-06T18:17:22.000Z,,dc-entertainment-remove-amber-heard-from-aquaman-2,Amber Heard could face 3 years in jail for faking evidence,"<p>Amber Heard could be charged with submitting falsified evidence in her abuse case against Johnny Depp. She claims that Johnny beat her up, but Johnny says that he can prove those black eyes were fake.</p>
<p>We already suspected as much because with such traumatic injuries comes swelling, and she had none. Not to mention the fact that her bruises moved from one day to the next, whenever it was necessary to paint them on for show.</p>
<p>In 2019 Amber Heard’s personal stylist, Samantha McMillen, went on record stating that she believes that her black eyes were fake, saying that: “On December 16, 2015, I spent much of the day and evening with Amber Heard, preparing her to appear on the James Corden show. I saw her throughout the day of December 16, 2015, in good light, at close range, wearing no makeup. Throughout the day of December 16, 2015, I could see clearly that Amber Heard did not have any visible marks, bruises, cuts, or injuries to her face or any other part of her body. She appeared as a guest on the James Corden show that day.”</p>
<p>There you have it.</p>
<p>In the state of California, a person who is found to have falsified evidence  can be convicted of a felony under California Penal Code sections 132 or 134 for a maximum sentence of 3 years. </p>
<p>The question is whether or not she'd do any time at all, even if convicted. So far, she's gotten away with a boatload of offences, including beating her husband, without seeing the inside of a jail cell. </p>
<p>This isn't the first time she has submitted falsified documents or has been faced with jail time. In 2016 Heard plead guilty for supplying falsified documents when she smuggled her two dogs into Australia. And she got out of any real punishment for that. </p>
<p>What do you think? Should Amber Heard go to jail for falsifying evidence and submitting false reports?</p>

How dare they confirm her for a return to the role of Mera. </p>
<p>But did they? </p>
<p>Everything I've read, including those statements confirming the official dates for the movie's release. And ALL  of them use language like ""The cast is EXPECTED to return."" or ""Amber heard is SET to return.""</p>
<p>Expected. Set. Prepared. Ready.</p>
<p>Nowhere does it say that Amber Heard is CONFIRMED to return. </p>
<p>I'm sure she wants to. She's certainly going to need the money to pay of Johnny Depp when he wins his 50 million dollar defamation suit against her. And she seems the type to NEED the fame that comes with stardom.</p>
<p>But let's not get ahead of ourselves. There are two law suits standing between Amber Heard and that role. Johnny's libel suit against the sun and his defamation case against Heard herself. If she's found in the wrong in either one of them, then she's got a lot to lose. </p>
<p>There's a morals clause in every contract in Hollywood these days. And if Heard loses in either one of those cases, the studio can, and probably will, fire her due to that morals clause. </p>
<p>Let's not forget that the filming and release date for AM2 was pushed back when these suits were filed, probably for exactly that reason.</p>
<p>WB DC aren't ignoring us. They're covering their collective asses. If they fire her just because of a petition, they open themselves up for a HUGE wrongful termination suit from Heard. </p>
<p>By waiting for the outcome of these cases, WB DC are giving themselves a valid reason to fire her. If she's fired for a morals clause violation, she can't sue them for wrongful termination. </p>
<p>Stay calm, folks. It's not over until it's over. Filming hasn't even started. Let's wait and see what happens with these law suits before we throw our outrage around. We know she's going to lose.

<p>Many in the Twitterverse (including me) are left wondering if this was just a coincidental styling choice made by Butti all by herself, or if Heard had a hand in dressing her lady love up like her ex husband. </p>
<p>The question would be: WHY? Is Heard trying to send the message that she can still lead Johnny around on a leash? Or is she doing it simply to mock him. With the libel trial against the sun coming up, it's entirely possible that Heard is simply trying to grab headlines the only was she can. The only was she ever could, really.

StarterPetitionUpdate,25837178,2020-03-03T18:47:52.000Z,,dc-entertainment-remove-amber-heard-from-aquaman-2,Amber Heard to testify in London next month,"<p>Amber Heard is all set to fly to London next month and testify in Johnny's libel suit against the Sun newspaper. The question I have is WHY? As I understand it, she doesn't have to. Has she been subpoenaed? </p>
<p>There are only two reasons I can think of that she would show up uninvited and pitch her two cents into the ring. </p>
<p>First, a toxic narcissist will to anything to try to save face. and they're masters of playing the victim. Amber Heard would likely jump at any chance to vilify Johnny and paint herself as the poor, terrorized victim of his unbearable abuse.</p>
<p>Primarily, I think she's going to talk about those texts that Johnny wrote to Paul Bettany. You know, the ones where Johnny talked about burning and drowning Amber, then fucking her dead corpse to make sure she's dead. Anybody with half a brain knows that abuse victims often fantasize that their abuser would die so that the abuse could stop. Johnny was venting to his friend about his abuser. He would never do such a thing. He said so in the very same text.</p>
<p>But Amber's likely won't play it that way. I'm willing to bet real money that she's going to show up and use that text to portray herself as a victim who was afraid for her very life. ""He was planning to KILL me!"" She'll probably testify, dabbing at the corner of her eye with a tissue. </p>
<p>Her testimony will have no bearing on the Sun case, because nothing can change the fact that Amber is the one who abused Johnny. No. What she's doing is setting up her testimony so that it will be a matter of record, so that she can use it in Johnny's defamation suit against her.</p>
<p>She plays the long game, let's not forget. She took ""damning"" photos and set herself up as the victim for probably the entirety of their relationship, knowing what she was ultimately going to do. I wouldn't doubt that the same thing is going on here.</p>
<p>The other reason the I can think of for her to show up and testify is to try to rattle Johnny, who will most likely be there. It's possible that she wants him to see her and fall to pieces, lose his resolve, or make a mistake and say something stupid.</p>
<p>Think about how crazy stupid in love with her he was. Is that really gone from within him? Or does he still have a soft spot for his ""made up"" ex wife? Could he see her, go all mushy and drop the defamation case?</p>
<p>I don't think so.</p>
<p>Four years is a long time, and a lot of things can happen. One of those things is that Johnny has recovered himself. He's gotten back who he is, and he's steeled his resolve to defend himself against allegations that just aren't true. Seeing her isn't going to make him lose that. If anything, seeing her will strengthen his resolve.</p>

Drop and comment and let me know what you think.</p>","{'id': '223184695', 'petitionMedium': {'url': '//assets.change.org/photos/5/wh/fb/orwhfBVgKPWkWfT-800x450-noPad.jpg?1583261273', 'processing': False}}",,,,against

<p>First, those texts were private messages. Depp was frustrated with his abuser. Heard was never intended to read those, therefore, they are not a threat to her. </p>
<p>Second, to state the obvious, Depp never burned or drowned Heard. In fact, in the same text, he confesses that he could never spray his rage at the woman he loves. Not only were those words never a threat in the first place, but he also asserts that he could never do such a thing. </p>
<p>And finally, let's not forget that Amber Heard DID burn Johnny Depp. She put a cigarette out on his face. That's a fact. </p>
<p>Let's stop focusing on something that never happened and start paying attention to what actually DID happen. </p>
<p>The fact that the mainstream media refuses to report on Amber Heard's clear admissions of guilt, but jump all over Johnny Depp's frustrated texts to his friend about something that never happened display the ongoing bias against a male survivor of domestic abuse.</p>

<p>Before any of that happened, ""Uncle iO"" outed sweet little Lily Rose Depp. Lily Rose had confided in iO about her personal proclivities, and iO took it upon himself to out her before she decided to out herself. iO wrote ""I'm so proud of my baby girl @lilyrose_depp. She decided hse wanted to be in @selfevidentproject because she falls somewhere on the vast spectrum, and I couldn't be happier to welcome her to the family.

<p>Lily Rose handled it with grace and dignity, but I can only imagine the pain of betrayal at the hands of somebody who her family had taken in as one of their own. </p>
<p>Then came iO's complicity in buddy Amber Heard's scheme to ruin Johnny depp - which failed miserably and backfired squarely in her face. </p>
<p>Next, iO claimed that Johnny Depp was fired from Pirates because he missed a month of filming. That would be the month that Johnny was recuperating from Amber cutting off part of his finger, and poor Johnny contracting MRSA three times, nearly dying. </p>
<p>Fact is that Johnny was dumped from Pirates one week after Heard's WaMo op-ed in which she obviously refers to being a victim of Johnny Depp's (nonexistent) abuse.</p>
<p>Over and over again, iO chooses to stab Johnny and his family squarely in the back, even though Johnny took iO into his home when he (iO) had nowhere else to go.</p>

<p>This latest fishing trip is Heard's most desperate attempt yet to smear Johnny Depp by associating him with Weinstein, Hollywood's biggest pariah. If she can smear enough mud on Johnny, she thinks, I guess, that she can get a pass for abusing him.</p>
<p>There is a link between Johnny Depp and Harvey Weinstein, of course. The 2004 movie, 'The Libertine.' The film was promoted by the Weinstein Company. As such, there's no guarantee that the owner of the post-production promotion company ever passed words with Johnny Depp, and there's certainly no proof whatsoever that Johnny had any knowledge whatsoever of Weinstein's misdeeds. </p>

<p>According to Roberts' deposition, ""Amber repeatedly berated him with increasing ferocity. She was insulting him, calling him names, and in the middle of this onslaught, I heard her specifically say 'Your career is over.' 'No one is going to hire you.' 'You are washed up.' 'Fat.' 'You will die a lonely man.' and also screaming things that were incomprehensible.""</p>
<p>""[Johnny] was responding to [Amber's] verbal attacks by saying 'Go away' and 'Just leave me alone.' Amber's screaming and berating rose to a fever pitch and Johnny kept saying 'Go away' and 'Leave me alone.'""</p>
<p>""I saw Amber lunge at Johnny, clawing, tugging, and aggressively pulling him. He continued to stand there telling her to stop and leave him alone.""</p>
<p>That was the incident where Heard threw a can of lacquer thinner at Johnny Depp's face, leaving an open gash on the bridge of Depp's nose.</p>
<p>Johnny never raised his voice or pushed her back. Roberts never saw Johnny being aggressive with Heard.</p>

<p>Now, there's a lobbyist who says the state senator and her now husband, Brian Townsend, sexually harassed her while the politician was still in the Arizona House of Representatives. Ugenti-Rita was a state representative between 2013 and 2015, meaning the alleged allegations happened before the politician made her accusations against Shooter.</p>
<p>The lobbyist alleges that Ugenti-Rita showed her photos of herself on her phone, and that Ugenti-Rita's husband, Townsend, sent explicit photos hif himself and his wife to the lobbyist. </p>
<p>The lobbyist also alleges that she was later invited up to Ugenti-Rita's hotel room, where Ugenti-Rita behaved provocatively and urged the lobbyist stay until Townsend could join them. </p>
<p>Arizona’s Senate Democratic Leader David Bradly said that the “allegations contained in the deposition appear to be a clear violation of our sexual harassment policy that warrants further investigation.""</p>
<p>This clearly illustrates that Amber Heard is likely not the first woman to use the #MeToo movement to hide her own criminal behavior by purporting to represent women's issues. </p>
<p>This outlines a fundamental problem with the #MeToo movement. While claiming to be representatives of abused women, the MeToo platform has created an environment where men can be persecuted with no proof whatsoever aside of a woman accusing him, the way Amber Heard accused her ex-husband Johnny Depp of abusing her. </p>
<p>Heard presented falsified photos as proof, and she became the darling of #MeToo, furthering her own career and public reputation at the cost of a man who did none of the things she accused him of.</p>
<p>Heard's photos were quickly debunked as fakes by other public photos the day before, the day after, and even later the same day showing her with no bruises or busted lip at all.</p>
<p>Ultimately, women like this don't represent women who really have been brutalized. In fact, there's almost irreperable damage. Until this flawed system is fixed, the real victims are the women who are forced to suffer in silence for fear that they won't be believed if they come forward to tell their stories and seek help.</p>","{'id': '223095647', 'petitionMedium': {'url': '//assets.change.org/photos/6/kg/ui/aEKGuiyRzYecRPQ-800x450-noPad.jpg?1581369402', 'processing': False}}",,,,against

<p>""“These signal an intention by Mr. Depp to litigate in the court of public opinion.”</p>
<p>She didn't mind the court of public opinion when it was swinging in her favor, did she? Well, too bad, babycakes. Sauce for the goose is good for the gander. If she'd been around Hollywood's A-list for more than ten minutes, she'd know that public opinion is a fickle, fickle thing. One minute, you're the darling of the media. The next, the whole world knows that you're a monster and nobody minds calling you out on it.</p>
<p>She'll have to get used to that. When Johnny wins his defamation case, she's not going to have anywhere to hide, no matter how many times she shows off her nipples. Little boys will oggle the view, but grownups will shun her for the monster she is. Hopefully, her only employment options will be the fabulous world of fast food, or porn. nothing in mainstream entertainment.</p>
<p>She'll also have to get used to being about 50 million dollars lighter. According to Celebrity Net Worth, Amber's 'only' worth about 9 million. If/when the verdict for that case swings in Johnny's favor, she'd going to have to start asking all her friends for loans to cover it. And I think she'll find herself in a very lonely place. </p>

<p>The ramifications for the #MeToo movement are far-reaching, too. By making herself the darling of #MeToo and domestic abuse victims, Heard has now made it even more difficult for real victims to come forward. If she lied, there's nothing stopping the media from saying that they did, too. She has single-handedly set domestic abuse victims back a hundred years. </p>
<p>In the meantime, Johnny is steadily filming the next Fantastic Beasts movie and working with his band, The Hollywood Vampires. Amber is steadily dating. </p>

Simply put: the competition. From the looks of it, December 2022 is the first Christmas season between now and then that won't have a big-ticket studio release. Specifically: Avatar.</p>
<p>Besides that, James Wan is a busy guy, slated to work first on his ""Trench"" horror flick - which Jason Momoa and Amber Heard are both reportedly attached to. </p>
<p>As horrific as the thought of Amber Heard alongside Jason Momoa in yet another film, the way for Aquaman 2 is good news. It gives plenty of time for Johnny Depp's defamation suit to hit the courts. When, not if, it's proven in a court of law that Amber Heard violently abused her ex husband - same as she did her ex wife - it should be pretty clear to those in charge of the DCU why she should be left out of it. </p>
