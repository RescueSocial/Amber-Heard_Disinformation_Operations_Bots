<b><i>Reddit - Social Network Analysis on Amber Heard's Case Example from Data Analysts, Researchers, and Scientists.</b></i>
<br><b>Reddit Analysis</b> - It's important to look at Reddit in the context of cross-platform operations and comparing - e.g., ages of accounts during peaks, statistical differences or similarities, natural language processing, timelines, repeated same texts in quantifications, and amplifications.
- <b>4 Reddit Reports for Per Year for 2018-2021 and a Users Report.
- Data from Reddit: 164,530 Contributions, 15,896 Submissions, 71,319 Accounts, Links</b>
- <b>5,025 Banned Reddit Accounts</b> are the highest amount of contributors in years of operations and get the highest percentage of Upscores (often hidden on Reddit profiles).
- Banned accounts with highest upvotes can show references to the disinformation operations from 2019-2021, e.g., '3rdPrizeIsYourFired,' 'the-speed-of-pain,' 'TruthbeThePrejudice.'
- Threats exist in all platforms, including Reddit.
- <i>Full View: In influence operations, 'call out' postings on platforms are used to confuse workers at social media companies to hide that they're amplified by bots. Reddit (as shown in prior precedence in multi-platform research papers) can be a sandbox to confuse workers and victims. E.g., 'execute 99' and 'good soldiers follow orders' showing within the Dec 2020-Jan 2021 Peaks of YouTube 'Amber Heard's 2020 Takeaway: Adapt and Survive' Simulation showing tens of thousands of the same texts with 'not a victim.' The statistics show that Reddit bans accounts seeing automation, and that minimum scores can also go to harmful users.</i> - See Research Papers folder

<b>Notes from Researchers: 
  <i><br>These reports are a part of Case Study: “Reddit Social Network Analysis Against Influence Operation” by analyzing accounts posting/commenting against a victim of a Social Bot Disinformation/Influence Operation.</b></i>
<br>We have four main datasets scraped from Reddit
<br>1. A dataset with submissions & comments data (2020).
<br>2. Users Data (from 2006 to 2020).
<br>3. A merged dataset (submissions & comments data, users data).
<br>4. Daily creation data (# of accounts created per day from 2006 to 2020).
<br><i>The data Timezone is Epoch/UTC.</i>

<i>Notes:</i> Reddit began to achieve a notable level of popularity in mid-2010, and it has expanded its reach since. It had become “really popular” in early 2013. Reddit was launched in June 2005. 
<br>The effect of 2020 is obvious, but we can see a small effect from 2021 as the data collected till May of this 2021.
<br><i>Reddit does not remove contributions and submissions from banned accounts.</i>

Newly created accounts in 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021
<br>As the data collected from 2018 to 2021, the most suspicious accounts are the new ones which are created between 2018 and 2021.

#### <b>Included Types of Analysis on Reddit:</b>
- New, Banned, Unverified Accounts Analysis
- Same and Repeated Texts Analysis
- NLP, wordclouds, negative texts and accounts
- Upscore/Downscore Ratios for banned, new, unverified account layers
- Top contributing accounts and banned accounts
- Accounts and same texts posting within seconds/multiple subreddits analysis - timings
- Timelines, peaks, anomalies, timings - comparing statistics
- Submissions, contributions, and accounts analysis

These are high volume operations, so these are merely some examples. Images and Highlights provide more, e.g., the November 2020 peak from mostly 2011 accounts, whereas, the Februrary 2020 peak is mostly from newly created accounts. Contrast this with the other platforms and their statistics.
