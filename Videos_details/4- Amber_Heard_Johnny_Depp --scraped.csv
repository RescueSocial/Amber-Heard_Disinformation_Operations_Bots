The court case between Johnny Depp and Amber Heard is raging on strongly, and it's anyone's guess how this is going to end. Not just because of how the case has gotten so messy, but because many people are standing up for Johnny Depp...and blasting Amber Heard at the same time. Throughout the trial/trials, Amber Heard has claimed that Johnny Depp has been abusive to her, but a lot of other people have stood up and said that Johnny ""isn't the type"" to do that, and some of the voices saying this have been pretty surprising.

About:
Four years later the couple were back in court, but this time in London. However, this was not Amber Heard's case - she had not chosen to be here. This was a libel action Depp had brought against a British newspaper, The Sun. At the heart of the case was his assertion that the allegations of physical abuse were an ""elaborate hoax"". Depp employed one of the best-known libel barristers in the country to try to prove the claims were untrue.
Over the next three weeks, Heard arrived at court each day and walked past her former husband's fans, who were convinced that it was their hero who was the victim and it was she who had assaulted him. In court her story, photos, memories and the accounts of her friends were all exposed to the world and said by Depp's team and supporters to be part of a plot to falsely prove that he was, as The Sun had claimed in April 2018, a ""wife beater"".

It was not just the fans and media who were watching carefully. Lawyers were already wondering, if he won, what impact this would have on women coming forward with claims of domestic violence. Outside, Johnny Depp would arrive each day to cheers. But his behaviour and lifestyle were also under the microscope - and a judge has now ruled that The Sun's allegations were ""substantially true"".

Estas son algunas cosas que tal vez no sabías sobre la vida de Amber Heard.

Heard y su ahora ex-esposo Johnny Depp se conocieron en el 2012 en el set de Diario de un Seductor y se casaron en el 2015. En mayo del 2016, Heard solicitó el divorcio y lo acusó de abuso doméstico. Heard escribió en la declaración,

""Durante toda nuestra relación, Johnny fue verbal y físicamente abusivo conmigo. Soporté un excesivo abuso emocional, verbal y físico de Johnny, que ha incluido ataques furiosos, hostiles, humillantes y amenazantes hacia mí cada vez que yo cuestionaba su autoridad o no estaba de acuerdo con él.""

Heard también presentó una foto en donde aparece con la cara lastimada. Afirmó que la herida fue causada por un golpe de Depp con su teléfono. Ella le dijo al tribunal,

""Vivo con el temor de que Johnny vuelva a [nuestra casa] sin avisar para aterrorizarme, física y emocionalmente.""

Pero la policía no encontró pruebas de ninguna agresión cuando respondió a una llamada por pelea doméstica en la casa de la pareja en mayo del 2016, y Heard se negó a presentar una denuncia penal. El abogado de Depp le dijo a la corte,

""[Heard] está intentando asegurar una resolución financiera prematura alegando abuso. Johnny no puede protegerse a sí mismo ni a Amber del escrutinio de los medios.""

Mientras que Heard acusó a Depp de violencia doméstica, ella fue arrestada por presunta violencia doméstica contra su ex pareja, la fotógrafa Tasya van Ree, en septiembre del 2009. Según TMZ, Heard y van Ree discutieron en un aeropuerto, y Heard presuntamente golpeó a van Ree. Fue arrestada y fichada por un delito menor de violencia doméstica, pero el fiscal se negó a seguir adelante con el caso, porque ambas mujeres vivían en California.

Años después, van Ree dijo públicamente que el incidente fue ""sobresensacionalizado,"" y describió a los oficiales que hicieron el arresto como ""homofóbicos"" - pero en realidad la oficial es una mujer gay, y escribió en Facebook,

""¡No soy homofóbica en lo absoluto! [...] El arresto se hizo porque hubo una agresión (yo lo presencié) y las partes involucradas estaban en una relación doméstica.""

Van Ree también emitió una declaración cuando los informes del arresto resurgieron en el 2016, diciendo,

""Es desgarrador que la integridad y la historia de Amber sean cuestionadas una vez más. Amber es una mujer brillante, honesta y hermosa y tengo el mayor respeto por ella. Compartimos 5 maravillosos años juntas y mantenemos contacto hasta el día de hoy.""

Amber Laura Heard is an American actress. Born and raised in Texas, she made her film debut in a minor supporting role in the sports drama Friday Night Lights, followed by a series of other small roles in television and film. Heard was married to her Rum Diary co-star Johnny Depp in 2015–2017. Their divorce drew significant media attention. In 2019, he sued her for defamation. Depp also sued the publishers of The Sun in a related libel suit, with Heard as a key witness for the defendants. In November 2020, the High Court of Justice of England ruled that Depp has lost his case and that the majority of Heard's allegations had been proven to a civil standard which Depp intends to appeal.

Johnny Depp is perhaps one of the most versatile actors of his day and age in Hollywood. He was born John Christopher Depp II in Owensboro, Kentucky, on June 9, 1963.

This was not meant to be because any of is fellow actors and actresses came out to defend him against Mrs. Heard. His lawyers went on to release evidence that has painted Amber as the aggressor and Jonny as the victim and from what we can see this is true.

This judge is done with Amber Heard and her lawyer. We got the whole transcript over here in regards to the Johnny Depp lawsuit. We are going to go the most relevant and important parts where she talks about the Johnny Depp and the evidence against her. 

We will start to see how Amber Heard is going lose this court case. This clearly shows that Amber Heard is lying. You will hear what the judge had to say to Amber Heard. It is the newest piece of celebrity news.

With the initial court date being pushed back, Johnny Depp and Amber Heard have been given some more time in order to gather more evidence for their individual cases. For quite some time, the two were firing evidence at each other in order to win in court. 

Ever since the recent release of the footage of the LAPD officers from the penthouse night of Amber Heard and Johnny Depp, things have not been looking all too bright for Amber Heard. Her team has been working tirelessly in order to back up her side, however Johnny Depp seems to have made the attempt to strike back.

It’s been a rough couple of months for Johnny Depp in regards to his ongoing battles with his ex-wife in Amber Heard. As the two are locked in a near eternal struggle in court over who was the abuser in their tumultuous relationship. Depp has maintained his innocence and has given evidence to state that Amber Heard was the one  but he keeps losing ground and court rulings. Including a Libel case against the UK Newspaper The Sun. But a new tactic might grant him a retrial. Allow us to explain. Be sure to like the video and subscribe to the channel

Do you think that the judge will indeed allow that to happen? Do you think that there is enough to get that to go through? Or do you think that it won’t be enough and thus, Amber Heard will keep gaining ground? Let us know in the comments below, be sure to subscribe and we’ll see you next time on the channel!

The ongoing case between Johnny Depp and his ex wife, Amber Heard, is one that has completely shocked the entire celebrity world. Fans of both have been trying to discover who is truly the bad guy in this case. Mainly because it was made clear at first that Johnny Depp was the one in the wrong in their relationship but then tons of evidence rose to the surface that it was actually Amber Heard who was at fault. With new and never seen before evidence rising to the surface, it seems that Johnny Depp may have more to further back up what he has been saying this whole time and could completely change the outcome of the case.

“You wanna cut me?” the “Pirates of the Caribean” star, 57, asked Heard in July 2016. “Cut me wherever you want. You wanna cut me somewhere. On the arm, chest? Where you wanna start? Cut me!”

Audio of the disturbing exchange was played in London’s High Court at Depp’s explosive libel trial against The Sun newspaper — which he says falsely branded him a “wife beater” in a 2018 article based on Heard’s allegations.

Amber Heard can be heard at times, agreeing with Johnny Depp's version of events, and at other times does not show any signs she sees the situation differently. From the tone of their voices we can get a sense of whether she might feel pressured to agree with him or whether she genuinely does and we can gain an understanding, from what they both say, of what happened between them that day. Amber Heard gives us insight into why she physically abused Johnny Depp and we get a sense of Amber's inability to control her emotions and the excuses she gives.

Later I look at what she said in court about the same event. Why does she claim that everything happened in the opposite way?  How does she try to encourage us to feel contempt towards Johnny Depp and to not take him seriously? And what does she say when questioned about the assaults on Johnny she previously admitted to?

I have done extensive research on narcissism and the effects of narcissistic abuse. I work as a coach specifically with people who have experienced an abusive relationship. Let me know in the comments section below what video you would like me to make about an aspect of narcissism that interests you and please subscribe to my channel!

I have done extensive research on narcissism and the effects of narcissistic abuse. I work as a coach specifically with people who have experienced an abusive relationship.

JOHNNY DEPP fans will not be successful in trying to ""pressure"" Aquaman 2 bosses into sacking the star's ex-wife, Amber Heard.

After Johnny Depp and Amber Heard clashed in a public court case over claims the Pirates of the Caribbean star was a ""wife-beater"", a petition was started. The online appeal was made by Depp's fans who called for Heard to be sacked from the upcoming DC Comics movie, Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom. The petition, titled ""Remove Amber Heard from Aquaman 2"", has ​gained ​more than 1.85 million signatures at the time of writing.

In response to this petition Heard said last year: ""Paid rumours and paid campaigns on social media don’t dictate [casting decisions] because they have no basis in reality.

""Only the fans actually made Aquaman and Aquaman 2 happen. I’m excited to get started next year."" (Via Entertainment Weekly)

Now, the producer of Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom has responded to the popular petition.

Peter Safran ​said: ""I don’t think we’re ever going to react to, honestly, pure fan pressure."" (Via Deadline)

Safran went on: ""You gotta do what’s best for the movie.

""We felt that if it’s James Wan and Jason Momoa, it should be Amber Heard. That’s really what it was.""

Addressing the ongoing campaign against Heard led by Depp fans, the Hollywood executive added: ""One is not unaware of what is going on in the Twitter-verse.

""But that doesn’t mean you have to react to it or take it as gospel or accede to their wishes.""

Safran repeated: ""You have to do what’s right for the film, and that’s really where we landed on it.""

Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom is currently due out late next year, but it has already been granted a stunning cast of actors.

Not only are Momoa and Heard reprising their roles of Arthur Curry and Mera respectively, they will ​also ​be joined by a legendary Star Wars villain ​actor ​once again.

Boba Fett star Temuera Morrison will be reprising his role as Arthur's father, Thomas Curry.

Earlier this year Morrison exclusively gave​ Express.co.uk​ the first details about his Aquaman return​.​

He revealed: ""I'm coming out [to shoot] in September. I think they want to do another one... I think they start earlier.""

When pressed about his storyline, Temuera would only say: ""I'm not in it that long!""

The Mandalorian actor also recalled some fond memories of working on the first Aquaman movie.

Temuera said: ""Yes, they gave me a wig and made me look younger! James Wan was there.

""I think I got the part because Jason [Momoa] loved [1994 film] Once Were Warriors [which Temuera starred in].

""Jason was a big mover because he wanted me to play his dad and the studio got talking and I met the casting agent... and yeah next minute I'm there.""",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/3gLxNtqhR18/default.jpg,120,90,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/3gLxNtqhR18/mqdefault.jpg,320,180,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/3gLxNtqhR18/hqdefault.jpg,480,360,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/3gLxNtqhR18/sddefault.jpg,640.0,480.0,Nonstop News,"['Johnny Depp fans demand Amber Heard is sacked', 'from Aquaman - producer responds', 'magazine news', 'the producer of Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom', 'has responded to the popular petition', 'Not only are Momoa and Heard reprising their roles of Arthur Curry', 'and Mera respectively', 'they will \u200balso \u200bbe joined by a legendary Star', 'Wars villain \u200bactor \u200bonce again', 'I think I got the part because Jason Momoa loved 1994 film', 'Once Were Warriors which Temuera starred in']",25,none,Johnny Depp fans demand Amber Heard is sacked from Aquaman - producer responds ( Magazine News ),"Johnny Depp fans demand Amber Heard is sacked from Aquaman - producer responds ( Magazine News )

Many of us are quite aware with the Depp Heard situation and well while things have heated down for quite a bit both are taking quite a few blows at each other.

If you've seen our previous videos you know how the trial has changed things for Johnny Depp for the
worse while many have supported him in the past. A few others have spoken against him however apparently something has come up in the court and the kind of change it invites in the trial is quite shocking.

#8: The Divorce In 2016
The reasons she provided for her taking this decision involved her accusing Depp of being an abuser, which was in fact quite shocking to his fans as well as the people who worked with Depp, as this side of Johnny was never witnessed by them.  Initially, everyone was siding with Amber, but eventually, the truth about Heards violent nature came out. At the time of the divorce between the two celebs, Depp was hushed and his word meant nothing as opposed to Ambers. When Amber provided the court with such reasons, Depp denied these accusations and even stated that all this was being done by Amber in her best interests, and not his. 

#7: The Lawsuit In 2019
The messes the two of them were drowning in were further worsened by the onset of a lawsuit. And no, this time it wasn’t filed by Amber, but in fact against her! Amber Heard expressed her feelings about Johnny Depp, using explicit content in an article published by the Washington Post, injuring Depp’s reputation, which led to the beginning of the 50 million dollar suit against Amber Heard. 

#6: Leaks Of Audio 2015
The audio leaks seemed to be the turning point for Depp’s ill fate as this was one of the most solid forms of proof that helped enable him to be proved as the innocent in the messy trial.What did the leaked audio messages contain? The conversations between the two were as toxic as their marriage. It involved a lot of content that went along the lines of them being involved in domestic violence, her being the main abuser. 

#5: Severed Fingertip
If Amber truly was the one to have faced being physically harmed why was Depp’s finger left severed? According to various sources, including Johnny Depp himself, Amber Heard injured Depp’s finger due to a heated argument that broke out between the two of them, resulting in him having to rush to the emergency room to get it fixed. In an interview, she claims he was the one who would constantly hurl things at her, when in fact later on it was proved it was just quite the opposite that was happening behind closed doors. 

#4: Depp's Bruised Face 2020 & Amber's Fake Bruises
To what extent this woman went to prove her innocence is quite disgusting we must say. At one point, Amber had exposed her scarring and bruising on social media to damage Depp. On investigating further into Amber’s bruises, they seemed to be fake as the next day she made an appearance with no trace of even a single scratch on her. 

#3: Premiere of Alice Through The Looking Glass
Depp did a fabulous job in the movie Alice Through The Looking Glass. His fans were quite enlightened with his presence on the day of its premiere, but the same cannot be said about Johnny Depp! Unfortunately, we all assumed his speech to include his dark humor which he constantly brings out from time to time but indeed many believe it to be a cry for help. He mentioned being in pain, being tired, and wanting to go home.


#2: Career 2016 Onwards
It is quite a well-known fact that once someone is surrounded by constant negativity, this not only takes a toll on their mental health but also starts affecting their professional life too. Depp met Amber on the sets of The Rum Diary, and both were happily married then. Depp fell into Amber’s trap, both ending their marriages and marrying each other a few years later. Depp was quite a huge hit in Hollywood. Everyone wanted to hire him. The array of films he was getting by the year was massive and all he was doing at every award function was hoarding awards. It is quite evident that following 2016, things for him took a turn downhill professionally. 

#1: Mother
Depp’s mother was quite well known for her difficult nature. Apparently, it was said Johnny was the only person who could tolerate her cruel nature. It was till her very end that he stood by her side and tended to all of her needs. If Depp could respect such a woman till her last breath, why would he ever harm someone who he claimed to have loved? There is no answer to that question by anyone but stands as a self-explanatory form of evidence to prove Depp was not the kind of man to hurt any woman, especially Amber.

Over the past year Johnny Depp and Amber Heard's relationship has been plastered across the headlines. The details of their life together were revealed when a British newspaper branded the Pirates of the Caribbean star a ""w-b"", claims which he disputed. Johnny Depp does not seem to be stopping any time soon when it comes to finding any evidence that will support him in his libel case against his ex wife Amber Heard.

Did Amber Heard just get booted for Aquaman 2? This would be great news to Johnny Depp and Aquaman fans around the world. The #FireAmberHeard movement is going strong. It seems the Aquaman 2 director, James Wan, does not even want Amber Heard in the movie. 

It seems like everyone is turning against Amber Heard. Including the actors in the movie such as Jason Momoa, Nicole Kidman, William Dafoe, etc. The Johnny Depp Amber Heard legal battle is still at the forefront of celebrity news. 

With the initial court date being pushed back, Johnny Depp and Amber Heard have been given some more time in order to gather more evidence for their individual cases. For quite some time, the two were firing evidence at each other in order to win in court. 

Ever since the recent release of the footage of the LAPD officers from the penthouse night of Amber Heard and Johnny Depp, things have not been looking all too bright for Amber Heard. Her team has been working tirelessly in order to back up her side, however Johnny Depp seems to have made the attempt to strike back.

One of the most well-known cases in today's day, considering its background, Johnny Depp and Amber Heard have had their differences spread out over the last few years. What began as a love story between two of the most established performers in Hollywood soon turned to bitter hatred for each other. Their love story turned into a tumultuous relationship in which both of them became toxic to each other. Everything the media got to know about the two pointed towards ill behaviour by the two towards each other. Regular visits to the court and constant finger-pointing made them sick of each other.

Johnny Depp i Amber Heard - kolejny zwrot w ich dramatycznym rozwodzie! Afera wokół rozstania Amer Heard i Johnnego Deppa wciąż twa, a na światło dzienne wypływają kolejne pikantne i niewygodne informacje. Ostatnio byli prawnicy gwiazdora przez przypadek upublicznili wiadomości, które aktor wysyłał do swojego przyjaciela, i które znowu nadszarpnęły jego dobre imię. Co się stało? I po czyjej stronie jest sprawiedliwość?

Find out next.

Amber Heard is the now 34 year old Hollywood actress who played in The Rum Diary, The Ward, and how could any of us forget her smash hit I Do..Until I Don’t, and as you all know, the now 57 year old Johnny Depp is a pirate.

Amber and Johnny got married on February 3, 2015, Amber filed for divorce on May 23, 2016, and the divorce was finalized on January 13, 2017. However, both Johnny and Amber claimed spousal abuse during the divorce hearings and Depp is now suing gossip magazines for libel, slander, and defamation for perpetuating the story, which greatly negatively impact his acting career.  So we’re going to break down Amber Heard’s body language during her intense deposition, along with their recorded conversations, to find out whether these accusations against Johnny Depp appear to be true or false.

Give this video a thumbs up if you think Amber Heard was lying
Give this video a thumbs down if you think Amber Heard was very truthful

Now in the comments, what would you do if you were Johnny Depp or if someone fabricated terrible lies about you? Would you sue them, would you take that false accuser down? Let everyone know in the comments below.

Remember to subscribe because we don’t want you to miss out on new body language and investigative videos that always seem to shake up YouTube, and I’ll see you at the top.

The Johnny Depp and Amber Heard court drama made a major plot twist when Johnny Depp filed a defamation lawsuit against his ex-wife. He not only claimed that she lied in court, but also that she was wronged toward him. However, the actors will need to wait even longer to get an official court ruling. If the court rules in Johnny Depp’s favor, Amber Heard could be facing serious consequences.

The possibility of Amber Heard going to jail already has fans asking who would replace her in Aquaman 2. And even if she doesn’t get sentenced to jail time, based on the information that Johnny Depp has already released to the public, many fans have petitioned for Amber Heard to be replaced in Aquaman 2 regardless. Rumors have even started swirling that Emilia Clarke would be her replacement. Be sure to watch the whole video and see what lies Amber Heard has been hiding all these years!

Now Twitter is reacting to all the craziness between Elon Musk, Johnny Depp, and Amber Heard's fake payment to the ACLU. Let's break it down in today's video.

With the initial court date being pushed back, Johnny Depp and Amber Heard have been given some more time in order to gather more evidence for their individual cases. For quite some time, the two were firing evidence at each other in order to win in court. 

Ever since the recent release of the footage of the LAPD officers from the penthouse night of Amber Heard and Johnny Depp, things have not been looking all too bright for Amber Heard. Her team has been working tirelessly in order to back up her side, however Johnny Depp seems to have made the attempt to strike back.

Hey everyone!  I know it has been while, but I finally completed my next video.  In this one, I'll show you never before seen evidence and surveillance footage from May of 2016.  I'll be breaking it all down.  Combining it with testimony and other evidence, I'll be showing why I believe Amber and her friends planned out a poorly executed, but somehow highly effective hoax.

It's been tricky keeping pace with all the new info.  To keep up with analysis as new info comes out, I've been using Twitter more than YouTube lately.  

But don't worry, I do plan on making more videos in the future, as this all continues to unfold.  I understand some would like for me to cover other cases.  I might in time.  However,  I feel like I can almost see the finish line, and I really want to see this through.

This week, American entertainer Johnny Depp lost a defamation suit he filed in London, suing the paper The Sun for considering him a ""wife-beater"" in one of their articles, a reference to his relationship with ex Amber Heard. The case was terrible, hauling the two entertainers' private lives into the spotlight. It was muddled, as well; each blamed the other for misuse. 
On the Internet, it appears to be that Johnny Depp has many individuals close by. Twitter, Reddit, and different stages are being overwhelmed with images, supporting the entertainer. There are, be that as it may, the individuals who can't help contradicting them. 

On Friday, Heard, 30, was allowed a transitory limiting request against her significant other of 15 months, asserting in court archives that the 52-year-old entertainer genuinely manhandled her all through their four-year relationship. Heard additionally asserted that Depp hit her with a cell and pulled her hair last Saturday night – presenting a new photograph of herself with what seems, by all accounts, to be a wound on her correct eye as proof. A LAPD representative revealed to PEOPLE that officials reacted to the scene however verified that ""there was no proof of any wrongdoing."" 

In court records reacting to Heard's cases, Depp's lawyer Laura Wasser affirmed that Heard ""is endeavoring to get an untimely monetary goal by claiming misuse."" As news broke of the claims, many stood up against the case, saying something regarding either side of the contention. Here's who falls where. Depp's ex Vanessa Paradis allegedly went to his safeguard, as indicated by a note acquired by TMZ. 

""In every one of these years I have known Johnny he has never been genuinely harmful to me and this looks not at all like the man I lived with for 14 awesome years,"" Paradis purportedly composed. 
Individuals couldn't affirm if the letter got by TMZ was really composed by Paradis. Her representative didn't quickly react to a solicitation for input. 

Vanessa's youngest sister Alysson, shared a highly contrasting legacy photograph of herself with Johnny on Sunday. ""You are and will consistently be family to me. You are one of the most clever and most adoring individuals I know,"" she wrote in the subtitle. Depp's 22-year-old little girl Lily-Rose posted a vintage Instagram pic of her and her dad on Sunday, subtitling the photograph with a message of help. 

""My father is the best, most cherishing individual I know,"" the model and entertainer wrote. ""He wasn't anything, nevertheless a superb dad to my younger sibling and I, and every individual who realizes him would say something very similar.""

Wasser additionally affirms that Heard exploited Depp at a passionate time his mom having kicked the bucket three days before Heard petitioned for legal separation on Monday. Strolling Dead star Laurie Holden defended Depp on Twitter, in an ""enthusiastic response to the attack of an individual via online media and the public objection for complete and utter rumination."" ""I most definitely will see Johnny Depp's new film,"" the 46-year-old entertainer tweeted about Alice Through the Looking Glass. ""His own life is only that. Individuals. Nobody knows th
e genuine truth so zip it."" 
Afterward, Holden explained her remarks, saying that she upholds survivors of homegrown maltreatment and that their claims ought to be secured under full response of the law. ""My sole expectation has been basically to support those that are making killing quick judgment calls to stop,"" she said. 

After co-featuring with Depp in three movies – Transcendence, The Tourist and Mortdecai – Paul Bettany sent messages of help to Depp on Twitter. 
""Known Johnny Depp for quite a long time and through a few connections,"" he composed. ""He's the best, kindest, gentlest man that I've known at any point. Simply saying."" Penelope Cruz expressed: I've seen Johnny in such countless circumstances and he is consistently kind to everybody around. He is perhaps the most liberal individual I know. During a half year of my first pregnancy, I went through each and every day with him while we shot Pirates of the Caribbean. clevver news johnny depp appeal amber heard aquaman 2 celebrity newsjohnny depp defamation case

""In every one of these years I have known Johnny he has never been genuinely harmful to me and this looks not at all like the man I lived with for 14 awesome years,"" Paradis purportedly composed. 
Individuals couldn't affirm if the letter got by TMZ was really composed by Paradis. Her representative didn't quickly react to a solicitation for input. 

Vanessa's youngest sister Alysson, shared a highly contrasting legacy photograph of herself with Johnny on Sunday. ""You are and will consistently be family to me. You are one of the most clever and most adoring individuals I know,"" she wrote in the subtitle. Depp's 22-year-old little girl Lily-Rose posted a vintage Instagram pic of her and her dad on Sunday, subtitling the photograph with a message of help. 

""My father is the best, most cherishing individual I know,"" the model and entertainer wrote. ""He wasn't anything, nevertheless a superb dad to my younger sibling and I, and every individual who realizes him would say something very similar.""

Wasser additionally affirms that Heard exploited Depp at a passionate time his mom having kicked the bucket three days before Heard petitioned for legal separation on Monday. Strolling Dead star Laurie Holden defended Depp on Twitter, in an ""enthusiastic response to the attack of an individual via online media and the public objection for complete and utter rumination."" ""I most definitely will see Johnny Depp's new film,"" the 46-year-old entertainer tweeted about Alice Through the Looking Glass. ""His own life is only that. Individuals. Nobody knows th
e genuine truth so zip it."" 
Afterward, Holden explained her remarks, saying that she upholds survivors of homegrown maltreatment and that their claims ought to be secured under full response of the law. ""My sole expectation has been basically to support those that are making killing quick judgment calls to stop,"" she said. 

After co-featuring with Depp in three movies – Transcendence, The Tourist and Mortdecai – Paul Bettany sent messages of help to Depp on Twitter. 
""Known Johnny Depp for quite a long time and through a few connections,"" he composed. ""He's the best, kindest, gentlest man that I've known at any point. Simply saying."" Penelope Cruz expressed: I've seen Johnny in such countless circumstances and he is consistently kind to everybody around. He is perhaps the most liberal individual I know. During a half year of my first pregnancy, I went through each and every day with him while we shot Pirates of the Caribbean. clevver news johnny depp appeal amber heard aquaman 2 celebrity newsjohnny depp defamation case

Will the Johnny Depp vs. Amber Heard saga EVER end?! Johnny’s $50 million defamation trial against his ex-wife has just been postponed AGAIN and is now scheduled for April 11, 2022!
This means we’ll be hearing about this celeb drama for at least another year!
But even though we’ll have to wait for a while to hear the final verdict on who lied about what, the fans have already made up their mind.
Even those who used to be Team Amber are now uniting behind the #JusticeforJohnny hashtag and accusing Amber of weaving a web of lies to ruin Johnny’s career.
So while we wait for the case to wrap up in court, let’s take a look at all the evidence pointing to Amber Heard lying about Johnny being the bad guy.

Coucou 🦋
Aujourd'hui, l'on parle du procès de Johnny Depp qui implique l'actrice Amber Heard et le magazine anglais The Sun. Nous allons principalement parler de la 1er partie du procès qui se déroule au royaume-uni. Nous conclurons la vidéo en survolant les informations qui sont sorties par rapport à la deuxième partie du procès qui se déroulera au USA. Dans cette video, nous allons aussi survoler les principales dépositions, les anciennes et nouvelles preuves, les suppositions autour d'une soit disant relation entre Amber Heard et Elon Musk, les 7 millions de dollars qu'elle a promis de donner à un hôpital : « Children hospital of los angeles » et bien d'autres choses.

Shiloh Nouvel Jolie-Pitt, the first biological child of Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt, recently stepped out looking much different from her usual tomboy self.
When Shiloh was just 2 years old, Angelina revealed that Shiloh wants to be a boy and for years, we’ve gotten used to seeing Shiloh wearing boy’s clothes and rocking a boyish haircut.
But these days, Shiloh is looking very much different from what we’re used to and it seems like her tomboyish style was just a phase.
So what’s really going on with Shiloh, and why is her gender identity making headlines?

This was recorded just months before they filed for divorce in May 2016, as a therapy exercise, with both parties aware of the recording.

i play some important clips that the Daily Mail provided, but I encourage you to listen to/watch the entire video: https://youtu.be/aca0KWoHtqQ.  It seems to truly confirms who the real abuser was in this relationship, prompting an international trending topic #JusticeForJohnnyDepp

Since many media outlets aren't covering it., I felt it was important to get the word out. Please share this to ensure all sides are heard. 

What are you thoughts on this topic? Do you believe Johnny Depp was unfairly defamed by Amber Heard? Or do you still believe Amber?

Johnny Depp’s lawyers said the video contradicts evidence given by Whitney Henriquez that Ms Heard had never been violent towards her. 

Ms Henriquez denied giving false evidence and said the fight referred to in the video was just verbal.

The case, the biggest English libel trial of the 21st century, is due to finish next week with closing submissions from both sides' legal teams on Monday and Tuesday, and a ruling expected at a later date.

Amber Heard just announced in her recent personal instagram post that she is now a mother! Well, it is inexplicably hard to believe, especially for a woman who has been the subject of many rumors and negative spotlight lately. Now she just announced that she is a mother? Just when you thought this Johnny and Amber situation cannot get any crazier, Amber gives you a pretty hard to beat plot twist! But who is the father of Amber Heard’s baby? How did she get away with having this child without the paparazzi finding out? Did this affect her Aquaman training? And most importantly, how on earth did this happen? A lot of rumors and sources are saying that Elon Musk might be the father of this baby. Well, the timeline between the mega businessman and the Aquaman star is a little messy, especially because this happened in the midst of the Johnny Depp and Amber Heard divorce process, but who knows if they might have rekindled their romance during this time period? Amber Heard had dated a series of men (and a woman) in these years after her split with Johnny Depp, but during all this time, no one really knows who the father of her newborn is. So is Elon Musk really the father of her daughter? Let’s find out in this video! But before everything else, make sure first to hit that subscribe button and notification bell for more updates. Now, let’s dive in!

First, let’s have a little recap. Amber and Johnny met in 2011, when they filmed their movie together, The Rum Diary. The former couple got married in a private ceremony, and lived their romantic marriage for over a year before everything came crashing down. In 2016, Amber decided to split with Johnny and made him out to be all sorts of bad things. This shocked a lot of people, especially fans at that time, and people were not easy to side with Johnny. This is a case that people are really sensitive about, especially with all the details involved. However, when some evidence surfaced that proved Amber wasn’t telling the truth, fans easily lost their sympathy for Amber Heard and sided with Johnny instead. This evidence included Amber having affairs with actor James Franco and multi-billionaire Elon Musk. The evidence also showed Amber admitting that she was really the one who hurt Johnny Depp, and that she never really donated her divorce settlement money to charity. But the real chaos started when first, news publisher The Sun called Johnny Depp a very bad name that affected him deeply. Johnny Depp was not just offended by this, he was furious, and so he filed a case against the news company. However, unfortunately for his team, he lost this suit in court. But this messy predicament did not end at that. After he lost this libel case, he was relieved of his recurring role as Grindelwald in the blockbuster film trilogy Fantastic Beasts. In its third installment, Johnny was banned from reprising his role. This upset many fans, of course, but other than that, the issue was ignited even more when Amber got an op ed article written in The Washington Post in 2018 explaining thoroughly her situation.

The recent filming of Aquaman 2 has stirred new negative comments against Amber Heard, and she even trended on twitter, and not in a good way. Many fans still want her out of the DC Extended Universe new film, as her former husband Johnny Depp was out from Fantastic Beasts 3 and even from Disney’s Pirates of the Carribean series, the films where basically Jack Sparrow is the lead. And now, Amber Heard has been brought into the spotlight once again.

Amber Heard dated a few men and a woman after her divorce with Johnny Depp. In 2016, she went public with multi billionaire and Tesla CEO Elon Musk, whom she dated for a year. Then after their official split in 2018, the actress moved on with art dealer Vito Schnabel and “It” director Andy Muschietti. Many fans speculate that Amber and Bianca, if they are still together and are just keeping their lives out of the limelight, may have decided to have a surrogate baby so they can live as one happy family. But there are stronger beliefs that Elon Musk is actually the father of her baby. 

Nevertheless, despite Amber’s new announcement, people just hope that the judges won’t bite on this bait she apparently made to lighten her trial. Johnny Depp had gone through a lot because of this roller coaster marriage and he deserved justice. As for Amber’s baby, we just hope she grows up well.

Amber Heard just announced in her recent personal instagram post that she is now a mother! Well, it is inexplicably hard to believe, especially for a woman who has been the subject of many rumors and negative spotlight lately. Now she just announced that she is a mother? Just when you thought this Johnny and Amber situation cannot get any crazier, Amber gives you a pretty hard to beat plot twist! But who is the father of Amber Heard’s baby? How did she get away with having this child without the paparazzi finding out? Did this affect her Aquaman training? And most importantly, how on earth did this happen? A lot of rumors and sources are saying that Elon Musk might be the father of this baby. Well, the timeline between the mega businessman and the Aquaman star is a little messy, especially because this happened in the midst of the Johnny Depp and Amber Heard divorce process, but who knows if they might have rekindled their romance during this time period? Amber Heard had dated a series of men (and a woman) in these years after her split with Johnny Depp, but during all this time, no one really knows who the father of her newborn is. So is Elon Musk really the father of her daughter? Let’s find out in this video! But before everything else, make sure first to hit that subscribe button and notification bell for more updates. Now, let’s dive in!

First, let’s have a little recap. Amber and Johnny met in 2011, when they filmed their movie together, The Rum Diary. The former couple got married in a private ceremony, and lived their romantic marriage for over a year before everything came crashing down. In 2016, Amber decided to split with Johnny and made him out to be all sorts of bad things. This shocked a lot of people, especially fans at that time, and people were not easy to side with Johnny. This is a case that people are really sensitive about, especially with all the details involved. However, when some evidence surfaced that proved Amber wasn’t telling the truth, fans easily lost their sympathy for Amber Heard and sided with Johnny instead. This evidence included Amber having affairs with actor James Franco and multi-billionaire Elon Musk. The evidence also showed Amber admitting that she was really the one who hurt Johnny Depp, and that she never really donated her divorce settlement money to charity. But the real chaos started when first, news publisher The Sun called Johnny Depp a very bad name that affected him deeply. Johnny Depp was not just offended by this, he was furious, and so he filed a case against the news company. However, unfortunately for his team, he lost this suit in court. But this messy predicament did not end at that. After he lost this libel case, he was relieved of his recurring role as Grindelwald in the blockbuster film trilogy Fantastic Beasts. In its third installment, Johnny was banned from reprising his role. This upset many fans, of course, but other than that, the issue was ignited even more when Amber got an op ed article written in The Washington Post in 2018 explaining thoroughly her situation.

The recent filming of Aquaman 2 has stirred new negative comments against Amber Heard, and she even trended on twitter, and not in a good way. Many fans still want her out of the DC Extended Universe new film, as her former husband Johnny Depp was out from Fantastic Beasts 3 and even from Disney’s Pirates of the Carribean series, the films where basically Jack Sparrow is the lead. And now, Amber Heard has been brought into the spotlight once again.

Amber Heard dated a few men and a woman after her divorce with Johnny Depp. In 2016, she went public with multi billionaire and Tesla CEO Elon Musk, whom she dated for a year. Then after their official split in 2018, the actress moved on with art dealer Vito Schnabel and “It” director Andy Muschietti. Many fans speculate that Amber and Bianca, if they are still together and are just keeping their lives out of the limelight, may have decided to have a surrogate baby so they can live as one happy family. But there are stronger beliefs that Elon Musk is actually the father of her baby. 

Nevertheless, despite Amber’s new announcement, people just hope that the judges won’t bite on this bait she apparently made to lighten her trial. Johnny Depp had gone through a lot because of this roller coaster marriage and he deserved justice. As for Amber’s baby, we just hope she grows up well.

The case between Amber Heard and Johnny Depp is one that people all over the world are becoming familiar with. Amber Heard is presenting herself to be in a bad situation that might be pretty hard to come back from. Someone also involved in this case is the Tesla billionaire, Elon Musk. Allow me to explain why Elon Musk is now a person of interest in this whole drama.

According to the Times-News source, Johnny Depp has appeared to have dragged Elon Musk into the Amber Heard saga. Just a couple of days ago it was stated that the Tesla billionaire is being brought back into Depp’s 50 million dollar libel action against his ex-wife, Amber. What some of you might not know is why. Well, Depp who had accused Elon of having an affair with Amber during their short-lasting marriage is bringing him back into the case again. However, Johnny Depp is bringing Elon into the mix for a different reason. Depp wants Elon to be interviewed and in this interview, Depp would like him to come forward and hand over the details of all the contact he has had with Amber Heard. The 57-year-old actor is suing her for 50 million dollars in Virginia over a 2019 op-ed article she wrote for the Washington Post. In the article, Amber described herself as a victim. Most of you might be aware of this, but the news about Elon being brought into the case really changes the game as there could be some new information that Elon could bring forward in order to either help Depp’s case against Amber Heard or the other way around. Johnny Depp has obtained a court order requiring Elon Musk, the 49-year-old CEO to give his testimony. This is where he will be questioned on the details about his relationship with Amber Heard. The reason for him being called forward is not to talk about their relationship or whatever they shared together, but Musk is being asked to come forward and bring forward any knowledge he has of her allegations against her ex-husband, Johnny Depp. This means that if he is aware of what the truth is in this case. Musk may be the one who holds some useful information that can make or break the case for either of the two. Depp is hoping that he comes forward and discusses the truth of what happened and not the lies that are being constantly spread. Elon is known for several different things, one of which is that he is the CEO of SpaceX, and the other being that he is the CEO of Tesla. Musk, who was estimated last month to be the world’s richest person with a worth of more than 185 billion dollars, is being required to provide details of phone calls, emails, letters, and text messages exchanged with Amber Heard during various periods in March 2015. Now, you may be thinking that this is invading Elon’s privacy but there are legitimate reasons behind it. Back when things were not so good between Amber Heard and Johnny Depp, it was stated that she was going to get a restraining order against Depp. When Amber decided to do this, the one she made sure to let know was Elon Musk. As she went on to tell him about the issue, he offered to pay and provide her with 24-hour security. He also shared that he liked Amber Heard, according to what the high court had to hear. Laws said that Musk offers to arrange 24/7 security for you, adding the offer would stand even if you never wanted to see me again. Anyway, sorry for being an idiot. The radio silence hurts a lot. It only matters because I really like you, said Elon. He has also been asked to hand over any documents relating to her 7 million dollar divorce settlement which she claimed to have donated to the American civil liberties union and the children’s hospital Los Angeles. The money that she in fact came forward to state that she had yet to give her settlement money over as it was promised back when she split with Depp.In other news, back when Johnny Depp unsuccessfully sued The Sun over an article describing him in a not-so-kind manner and questioning why J.K Rowling let him appear in the fantastic beasts’ film because of the allegations Amber Heard stated about Depp.The high court was told that Elon Musk became a regular late-night visitor to Amber Heard monthly.

More Amber Heard Aquaman 2 celebrity news. This might be good news for Johnny Depp fans. The #FireAmberHeard campaign continues. This is all going amid the Johnny Depp Amber Heard legal battle.

With the initial court date being pushed back, Johnny Depp and Amber Heard have been given some more time in order to gather more evidence for their individual cases. For quite some time, the two were firing evidence at each other in order to win in court. 

Ever since the recent release of the footage of the LAPD officers from the penthouse night of Amber Heard and Johnny Depp, things have not been looking all too bright for Amber Heard. Her team has been working tirelessly in order to back up her side, however Johnny Depp seems to have made the attempt to strike back.

Ever since the Johnny Depp and Amber Heard scandal began, fans have been taking sides and choosing who they want to support in the legal battles. At first, everyone was on Ambers side, supporting her story but now it seems the tables have turned.

Fans of Johnny have started a change.org petition to have Amber Heard removed from her role as Mera in Aquaman 2 and over 1.8 million people have signed the petition and the number just keeps rising! However, after the pandemic started last year, many movies and releases have been postponed and filmings have been rescheduled due to their inability to play in theaters, comic book movies were particularly impacted by this. But it seems that things are looking better in 2021 and movies will go back to resume filming and appear in theaters this year. Which begs the question, who will play ""Mera"" in Aquaman? Will Amber continue her role, or will she be replaced by someone else?

While some celebrities prefer living a quiet life away from the public, others just have so many scandals following them. In this video, we are going to talk about Johnny Depp and Amber Heard, who have been on each other’s throats ever since they split up and how Amber Heard might be facing jail time for one mistake she made in all this.

With the initial court date being pushed back, Johnny Depp and Amber Heard have been given some more time in order to gather more evidence for their individual cases. For quite some time, the two were firing evidence at each other in order to win in court. 

Ever since the recent release of the footage of the LAPD officers from the penthouse night of Amber Heard and Johnny Depp, things have not been looking all too bright for Amber Heard. Her team has been working tirelessly in order to back up her side, however Johnny Depp seems to have made the attempt to strike back.

After she first accused her ex-husband Johnny Depp of physical aggression back in 2016, Amber received support from both fans and fellow celebs.

But as it turned out, it was actually the opposite. Just a year after their private wedding ceremony, problems started spiraling in, and now, their divorce and lawsuits are even more excruciating and longer than the marriage itself. But how exactly did this happen? Well, let’s first go back to where the Johnny Depp - Amber Heard story started in the first place. 

Johnny and Amber first ignited a spark between them when they starred together in the 2011 comedy-drama film, The Rum Diary. Johnny portrayed a journalist who was immediately smitten with Amber’s character. However, this love story between the two quickly travelled from screen to real life. Amber Heard even told Vogue quickly after the release of the film that, “Working with Johnny was amazing. It was better than I ever imagined, which is really saying something.” Technically, hearing these words from the actress already hinted that the two really hit it off easily during their film taping, and even though the two of them did not quickly jump into a relationship right after the film shooting, the same year that the film was released, the relationships they both were in at the time fell apart, and that suggested quite a rare coincidence. Depp was with his then-partner Vanessa Paradis whom he lived with for 14 years and whom he had two kids with, while Heard was with her then-girlfriend Tasya van Ree. After the film, and the rumors circulating about Johnny and Amber’s involvement with each other, Johnny and Vanessa’s relationship ended, while Amber ended things too with Tasya van Ree. Then, in 2012, the two officially started dating. The couple showed everyone that they were deeply in love with each other. But now, their relationship has turned out to be one of the messiest in history, considering their year-long marriage. 

In 2014, after a couple of years dating each other, Johnny Depp and Amber Heard announced their engagement. Amber was spotted wearing an engagement ring, which quickly sparked rumors about an upcoming wedding between the couple. This rumored engagement did not stay secret long enough, as Johnny himself confirmed this in an interview after discussing wedding planning and pointing out that he was wearing ""a chick's ring"" on his finger. In 2015, after several years of dating, Johnny married Amber in a private ceremony in their home in LA. Johnny Depp is no amateur star, and neither is Amber Heard. So this wedding did not stay secret for too long. The marriage started how everyone expected it would be --near perfect and rich with love. They were both wealthy personalities after all. But there’s a saying that goes around that says, “you shouldn’t really believe everything you see on picture.” 

In 2017, the couple was officially divorced, but the war they were fighting was definitely far from over. In 2018, Amber wrote an op-ed to The Washington Post entitled “I spoke up – and faced our culture's wrath. That has to change,” where she explained that she was hurt, and in which she spoke about the treatment of women in these types of cases. Despite not involving Johnny’s name on her statement, Johnny’s team felt that it was pertained to him, having recently filed a complaint against him and, well, technically they just got out of their failed relationship. So, in March of 2019, the 57 year old actor took action and filed a lawsuit of $50 million against her, for defamation over the said article in the Washington Post. The suit said that Amber ""is not a victim of domestic abuse, she is a perpetrator,"" and denied that Johnny ever abused her. At the time, Depp's lawyer called the article an ""abuse of the #MeToo movement"" and claimed Heard ""masquerades as victim rather than abuser."" And instead, the suit said that her allegations were part of an ""elaborate hoax to generate positive publicity"" for the actress. Johnny also testified that he was actually the one being hurt by his wife before, which was proven through recorded phone calls. Johnny also brought up Amber’s alleged cheating acts and affairs with actor James Franco and multi-billionaire Elon Musk.

In 2015, after several years of dating, Johnny married Amber in a private ceremony in their home in LA. Johnny Depp is no amateur star, and neither is Amber Heard. So this wedding did not stay secret for too long. The marriage started how everyone expected it would be --near perfect and rich with love. They were both wealthy personalities after all. But there’s a saying that goes around that says, “you shouldn’t really believe everything you see on picture.” 

In 2017, the couple was officially divorced, but the war they were fighting was definitely far from over. In 2018, Amber wrote an op-ed to The Washington Post entitled “I spoke up – and faced our culture's wrath. That has to change,” where she explained that she was hurt, and in which she spoke about the treatment of women in these types of cases. Despite not involving Johnny’s name on her statement, Johnny’s team felt that it was pertained to him, having recently filed a complaint against him and, well, technically they just got out of their failed relationship. So, in March of 2019, the 57 year old actor took action and filed a lawsuit of $50 million against her, for defamation over the said article in the Washington Post. The suit said that Amber ""is not a victim of domestic abuse, she is a perpetrator,"" and denied that Johnny ever abused her. At the time, Depp's lawyer called the article an ""abuse of the #MeToo movement"" and claimed Heard ""masquerades as victim rather than abuser."" And instead, the suit said that her allegations were part of an ""elaborate hoax to generate positive publicity"" for the actress. Johnny also testified that he was actually the one being hurt by his wife before, which was proven through recorded phone calls. Johnny also brought up Amber’s alleged cheating acts and affairs with actor James Franco and multi-billionaire Elon Musk.

Amber Heard on the Stand in Johnny Depp's Libel Case

https://youtu.be/iT2Kiyt7-rk

Amber Heard and Johnny Depp's divorce has been a surprise to the public, and now it's
been a several years of legal battle with no end in sight. It is no secret that Johnny Depp and
Amber Heard have been in a divorce case involving domestic abuse. At one point, Amber
claimed that Johnny was abusive and he didn't do much to fight back. Later, as the
proceedings began, Johnny made statements that Amber was the abuser. We’re still seeing
the fallout of Johnny Depp‘s catastrophic defeat in the British High Court last year. His libel
case brought against The Sun newspaper was intended to refute accusations that he was a
drug-addled domestic abuser and expose ex-wife Amber Heard as a fantasist. But it
backfired spectacularly, as not only was Depp’s dirty laundry aired in public, but the judge
found Heard’s testimony convincing and ruled that it isn’t libellous to describe him as a
“wife-beater.”
Consequences came fast. He was almost immediately booted off Fantastic Beasts 3, has
reportedly lost several high-profile upcoming roles, and insiders say he’s currently blacklisted
in Hollywood. But the most painful blow may come from Disney, as the studio is apparently
planning to move forward on a Pirates of the Caribbean movie without Captain Jack Sparrow
(but there’s also an information that Disney allegedly rehired Johnny Depp but no one knows
for sure). But according to the latest information, Amber Heard was exposed by her lawyer
and the body language analyst announced that Amber Heard was not honest by accusing
Johnny Depp! And it seems like things are going so great for Amber as well! Recently she
was replaced by Emilia Clarke for the role of Mera in Aquaman 2, Amber is now abandoned
by her own legal team. Which means something really serious happened as so many people
changed their minds and now they are on Johnny Depp's side. Actually, you may remember
that Amber Heard's former personal assistant claimed that she told the actress about a
violent se**al as**ult she had endured, only for Heard to “twist"" the story for her own use.
Kate James gave dramatic testimony at Johnny Depp's libel trial against a British tabloid
newspaper that accused the actor of abusing ex-wife Heard during their relationship. Believe
it or not - it is up to you, but here is something else you need to know about Amber Heard.
Anyways, the tables are turned now and many celebrities and fans support Johnny Depp,
and they believe him! Moreover, now they are accusing Amber of orchestrating a hoax to
ruin Johnny Depp’s career. And what is more, so many professionals from all walks of life
have come forward to prove that Amber is lying. And someone who showed the whole world
that Amber was not honest testifying in court against Johnny was body language analyst
Logan Portenier from the popular YouTube channel ‘OBSERVE’. According to Logan
Portenier, Amber Heard’s behaviour and facial expressions in her infamous 2016 court
deposition were strange and it was the reason why Logan decided to make a deep analysis
of Amber’s body language.
Amber Heard can be seen in a recording smirking and rolling her eyes while listening to a
recording of herself. In this video, the Aquaman star can be seen rolling her eyes and eating
what seem to be cookies. She looks totally disinterested by what’s going on in the recording.
First, fans thought she was behaving that way because she was stressed out and scared.
But body language expert is convinced that the real reason why Amber Heard looks and
sounds like she is lying is because she actually is!

In the recording Heard is listening to with the lawyers, Depp can be heard claiming that
Heard hit him with a bathroom door and then punched him in the jaw. She denies having
slammed the door in his face deliberately and then apologises for having hit Depp in the face
on purpose. She can be heard pleading: “I just reacted and I’m sorry. It’s below me.” But why
does she still act like she doesn’t care? At least right now, during the deposition.

Amber Heard on the Stand in Johnny Depp's Libel Case

https://youtu.be/iT2Kiyt7-rk

Amber Heard and Johnny Depp's divorce has been a surprise to the public, and now it's
been a several years of legal battle with no end in sight. It is no secret that Johnny Depp and
Amber Heard have been in a divorce case involving domestic abuse. At one point, Amber
claimed that Johnny was abusive and he didn't do much to fight back. Later, as the
proceedings began, Johnny made statements that Amber was the abuser. We’re still seeing
the fallout of Johnny Depp‘s catastrophic defeat in the British High Court last year. His libel
case brought against The Sun newspaper was intended to refute accusations that he was a
drug-addled domestic abuser and expose ex-wife Amber Heard as a fantasist. But it
backfired spectacularly, as not only was Depp’s dirty laundry aired in public, but the judge
found Heard’s testimony convincing and ruled that it isn’t libellous to describe him as a
“wife-beater.”
Consequences came fast. He was almost immediately booted off Fantastic Beasts 3, has
reportedly lost several high-profile upcoming roles, and insiders say he’s currently blacklisted
in Hollywood. But the most painful blow may come from Disney, as the studio is apparently
planning to move forward on a Pirates of the Caribbean movie without Captain Jack Sparrow
(but there’s also an information that Disney allegedly rehired Johnny Depp but no one knows
for sure). But according to the latest information, Amber Heard was exposed by her lawyer
and the body language analyst announced that Amber Heard was not honest by accusing
Johnny Depp! And it seems like things are going so great for Amber as well! Recently she
was replaced by Emilia Clarke for the role of Mera in Aquaman 2, Amber is now abandoned
by her own legal team. Which means something really serious happened as so many people
changed their minds and now they are on Johnny Depp's side. Actually, you may remember
that Amber Heard's former personal assistant claimed that she told the actress about a
violent se**al as**ult she had endured, only for Heard to “twist"" the story for her own use.
Kate James gave dramatic testimony at Johnny Depp's libel trial against a British tabloid

La coherencia entre sus palabras, conocer el significado de las expresiones faciales, movimientos corporales, así como el contexto de la situación, te ayudarán a interpretar el verdadero mensaje que te están enviando en secreto.

Hey everyone!  This audio was first reported on by The Daily Mail.  They obtained a 31 minute recorded phone call between Johnny Depp and Amber Heard.  This was during their divorce in 2016.

This new audio comes fresh off of last weeks discovery of a separate audio conversation in which Amber admits to abusing Johnny Depp on multiple occasions (uncensored link below).  This is not the entirety of the new audio.  I chose to pick some key points to speak about and give important information about them.

However, this is a completely uncensored version.  Warning for foul language.  I will consider uploading the entire audio (uncensored) at some point.  But if you want to listen to the whole thing uninterrupted, I'll post the link to the Daily Mail article below.

Amber Heard remains at the frontline of celebrity news due to his ongoing legal battles with ex husband Johnny Depp. The Johnny Depp Amber Heard court case has gotten ugly for many reasons.

While some celebrities prefer living a quiet life away from the public, others just have so many scandals following them. In this video, we are going to talk about Johnny Depp and Amber Heard, who have been on each other’s throats ever since they split up and how Amber Heard might be facing jail time for one mistake she made in all this.

With the initial court date being pushed back, Johnny Depp and Amber Heard have been given some more time in order to gather more evidence for their individual cases. For quite some time, the two were firing evidence at each other in order to win in court. 

Ever since the recent release of the footage of the LAPD officers from the penthouse night of Amber Heard and Johnny Depp, things have not been looking all too bright for Amber Heard. Her team has been working tirelessly in order to back up her side, however Johnny Depp seems to have made the attempt to strike back.

Witnesses of the domestic abuse refused to speak publicly because of the #Hollywood and cultural setting which doesn't reward helping victims - even if it's the right thing to do.

In this video, Amber Heard is threatened by Johnny Depp with a knife after she refuses to cut him when he asks her to, and he mocks her about scars and going to court. A video shows JD saying he headbutted Amber, but ""that wouldn't break a nose.""

A photo of missing Anthony Fox was sent by an alleged romantic partner of ex-staff saying staff are threatened with it since he wanted to testify against Depp. Similarly, #EvanRachelWood who was abused by JD's best friend #MarilynManson is shown reading a testimony that Manson threatened people if they wanted to expose him and threatened Evan with killing himself, yet at the same time violently abusing her and causing fear for numerous people.

This video links Hollywood/ #LosAngeles culture (claiming women want fame and they shouldn't stand up for victims), Hate Online for being a woman and sexuality/LGBT identities, and covering up abuse with bystanders.

With the initial court date being pushed back, Johnny Depp and Amber Heard have been given some more time in order to gather more evidence for their individual cases. For quite some time, the two were firing evidence at each other in order to win in court. 

Ever since the recent release of the footage of the LAPD officers from the penthouse night of Amber Heard and Johnny Depp, things have not been looking all too bright for Amber Heard. Her team has been working tirelessly in order to back up her side, however Johnny Depp seems to have made the attempt to strike back.

Secret email reveal that Amber Heard may not have made that donation to the ACLU or written that 2018 op-ed. Sit tight as we break it all down.

Amber Heard Faces 10 Years In Prison For Accusations Against Johnny Depp!!!

https://youtu.be/UvsHWTGHmts

Amber Heard and Johnny Depp have been involved in major legal battles for years now and
it seems that this drama is coming to an end now with new revelations and plot twists. It is
not easy to keep up with Johnny and Amber's case but what is most important here is that
Amber Heard is potentially facing jail time.
The court drama made a major plot twist when Johnny Depp filed a defamation lawsuit
against his ex-wife. He not only claimed that she lied in court, but also that she was abusive
toward him. However, the actors will need to wait even longer to get an official court ruling. If
the court rules in Johnny Depp’s favor, Amber Heard could be facing up to three years of jail
time.
Basically, Amber Heard claimed that Johnny Depp had physically and emotionally abused
her. Their original court drama in 2015 resulted in a restraining order against Johnny Depp,
but that’s also where the blurry lines began. Johnny claims that Amber had faked her black
eye seen at the court, and Amber Heard’s stylist corroborated this.
She stated, “Throughout the day of December 16, 2015, I could see clearly that Amber
Heard did not have any visible marks, bruises, cuts, or injuries to her face or any other part
of her body.”
But this was not the only time Amber Heard lied and was caught lying. Why would she do
that all the time? It was her strategy. She wanted to play a victim and she was good at it until
the truth came out. Even in 2017 she still managed to convince everyone that in this
situation she suffered from Johnny Depp's actions against her. Amber Heard made people
trust her and, moreover, she almost ruined Johnny Depp’s career, as the publicity called him
a ‘wife beater’ and supported Amber and sympathized with her.
While nothing could be proven, Amber Heard’s accusations against Johnny Depp were
enough to significantly damage Johnny’s reputation and acting career. The story also almost
derailed the latest Pirates of the Caribbean movie, Dead Men Tell No Tales, Johnny Depp
has faced significant levels of hate and ostracizing over the past five years. But then things
have changed.
The first thing which ruined Amber Heard's vicious plan was the leaked audio. And since the
audio leak, the internet has already returned to Johnny Depp's side of the issue. Johnny
Depp filed a defamation lawsuit against his ex-wife just over a year ago, and Amber Heard
attempted to get the case dismissed but her request was denied.
Johnny Depp initially filed the suit to sue Amber Heard for $50 million. But now it appears
that she could not only be forced to pay the sum, but she could also be facing jail time.
According to the International Business Times:
“If Heard will be proven guilty of faking her bruises, she could face three years of
imprisonment. According to the Wallin & Klarich Law Firm, the California Penal Code Section
141 PC stated that it is illegal to alter, modify, plant, place, conceal, manufacture or move
any physical matter with the intention of causing someone to be charged with a crime. Some
would face felony charges for this”.
But it doesn’t stop there. Amber Heard could also be charged with offering false evidence.
These are also considered felony crimes and each carry a maximum sentence of up to three
years.
And again, it doesn’t stop here. More and more evidence has come forward to showcase
that Amber Heard was the one who abused Johnny Depp and that she had a strategy of
making people think she was innocent. The number of times Amber lied is impressive: she
was caught lying in court (the audio recording situation), she asked or even forced people to
lie for her in court and she stole her assistant’s s*xual assault story and used it as her own.
Later it turned out that Amber Heard has a history of violence.
...
And now I want to know your opinion about this situation. Do you think Amber Heard is
facing jail time? And what’s gonna happen with Johnny Depp’s career? Let me know your
opinion in the comments section down below.

In yet another twist, a concierge has claimed via written witness statement in court that Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk regularly visited Amber Heard at her ex-husband and Hollywood actor Johnny Depp's Los Angeles penthouse while they were still together, the media reported.

Because of these reports, Elon Musk has spoken up about this issue and speaks against his ex-partner Amber Heard and somehow defended Johnny Depp. If you are curious about his claims, be sure to watch the whole video because it’s pretty crazy!

Johnny Depp and Amber Heard have been battling in court over the validity of
her accusations of domestic violence. However, this story took an even juicier
side when Amber Heard's friends started supporting Johnny Depp and testifying
against Amber Heard.
Make sure you stay till the end to see which Amber Heard’s friends sided with
Johnny Depp and what they have to say about Amber.
Despite the fact that Amber Heard’s vicious plan to ruin Johnny Depp’s career
was pretty successful lately, it seems like right now the tables have turned. As
you may already know, there have been several times when Amber Heard was
caught lying or using other people to stay in the driver's seat in this case. She
allegedly bribed her own sister, and used her assistant’s s*xual assault story.
Basically, things got very dirty and it seems like her fans, friends and some
other people don’t want to be linked to the perfect liar.
So, let’s start with Twitter and some fans’ thoughts on Amber Heard’s lies.
When Amber Heard said it out loud that Johnny Depp was an ab*ser and even
showed bruises, fans couldn’t help but bombarded Amber with tweets and
comments. Among the Twitter users was Adam Waldman - a former member of
Johnny's legal team - who tweeted a picture of the actress as he tried to discount
her allegations against her ex-husband.
Alongside the images he wrote: “12/15/15 allegation 'I had bruised ribs. Bruises
all over my body, bruises on my forearms from trying to defend the blows. I had
2 black eyes. I had a broken nose. I had a broken lip. Justice Nichols - I believe
her. UK Appeals Court - we believe him. But oops ... PHOTO SHOOT!”
Responding to the post, the actress said: “Yes Mr Waldman, I may be wearing
makeup on this occasion but on every occasion you will still be short.”
Then another Twitter user commented, “I'd rather be short than an abusive gold
digger Woman shrugging”, Amber hit back, “It's good to be realistic with your
goals”. Then, there was another tweet, written in Spanish that read, “Amber
Heard talking to Johnny Deep's lawyer regarding a set of photos where she
claims she was made wearing makeup to cover hit marks, a broken nostril,

bruises and more made by Johnny...but...”, the actress replied, “And so?” Looks
like Amber Heard is having fun and doesn't care what people say about her.
Amber Heard could expect such a reaction from people and, probably, that is
why she is so calm and confident. But what she did not expect was that her
friends sided with Johnny Depp. You have to wonder who and why betrayed
Amber Heard, and we are going to break it down for you in a minute.
Amber Heard was shocked when Laura Divenere (interior decorator to the stars)
and Amber’s former friend testified against her. Laura Divenere worked for
Johnny Depp and Amber Heard as their interior decorator in downtown LA in
the Eastern Columbia Building from July 2014 to sometime in 2016. And after
the pair splitted up Laura continued to work for Amber. She explains, ""I have
been and continue to consider myself a friend of Amber's. I remain in regular
contact with Amber. I have not communicated with Mr. Depp since 2016."" It is
an interesting ally in this case for Johnny Depp as she is the first person in the
case to identify as a friend of Amber Heard's but give testimony in support of
Johnny.

Plus I want to know your opinion about Amber Heard’s friends taking Johnny
Depp’s side. Do you think they just don’t want to be linked to Amber Heard
because she is a liar? Let me know your opinion in the comments section down
below. Thanks for watching this video and don’t forget to hit that subscribe

About Johnny Depp: John Christopher Depp II (born June 9, 1963) is an American actor, producer, and musician. He has been nominated for 10 Golden Globe Awards, winning one for Best Actor for his performance of the title role in Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street (2008), and has been nominated for three Academy Awards for Best Actor, among other accolades. He is regarded as one of the world's biggest film stars.[1][2]

Depp rose to prominence on the 1980s television series 21 Jump Street, becoming a teen idol. He has gained critical praise for his portrayals of inept screenwriter-director Ed Wood in the film of the same name, undercover FBI agent Joseph D. Pistone in Donnie Brasco, author J. M. Barrie in Finding Neverland, and Boston gangster Whitey Bulger in Black Mass. Depp is the third highest-grossing actor worldwide, as films featuring Depp have grossed over US$3.7 billion at the United States box office and over US$10 billion worldwide.[3] He has been listed in the 2012 Guinness World Records as the world's highest-paid actor, with earnings of US$75 million.[4] His most commercially successful films are the Pirates of the Caribbean series, which grossed US$4.5 billion, the Fantastic Beasts film series, which grossed US$1.3 billion, Alice in Wonderland, which grossed US$1 billion, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, which grossed US$474 million, and The Tourist, which grossed US$278 million.
Depp had a supporting role in Oliver Stone's 1986 Vietnam War film Platoon and played the title character in the 1990 romantic dark fantasy Edward Scissorhands. He later found box office success in the adventure film Sleepy Hollow (1999), the swashbuckler film series Pirates of the Caribbean (2003–present), the fantasy films Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (2005) and Alice in Wonderland (2010), the animated comedy western Rango (2011) (in which he voiced the title character), and most recently Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald (2018). Depp has collaborated on nine films with director, producer and friend Tim Burton. Depp was inducted as a Disney Legend in 2015.[8] He has performed in numerous musical groups, including forming the rock supergroup Hollywood Vampires along with Alice Cooper and Joe Perry.

About Johnny Depp: John Christopher Depp II (born June 9, 1963) is an American actor, producer, and musician. He has been nominated for 10 Golden Globe Awards, winning one for Best Actor for his performance of the title role in Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street (2008), and has been nominated for three Academy Awards for Best Actor, among other accolades. He is regarded as one of the world's biggest film stars.[1][2]

Depp rose to prominence on the 1980s television series 21 Jump Street, becoming a teen idol. He has gained critical praise for his portrayals of inept screenwriter-director Ed Wood in the film of the same name, undercover FBI agent Joseph D. Pistone in Donnie Brasco, author J. M. Barrie in Finding Neverland, and Boston gangster Whitey Bulger in Black Mass. Depp is the third highest-grossing actor worldwide, as films featuring Depp have grossed over US$3.7 billion at the United States box office and over US$10 billion worldwide.[3] He has been listed in the 2012 Guinness World Records as the world's highest-paid actor, with earnings of US$75 million.[4] His most commercially successful films are the Pirates of the Caribbean series, which grossed US$4.5 billion, the Fantastic Beasts film series, which grossed US$1.3 billion, Alice in Wonderland, which grossed US$1 billion, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, which grossed US$474 million, and The Tourist, which grossed US$278 million.
Depp had a supporting role in Oliver Stone's 1986 Vietnam War film Platoon and played the title character in the 1990 romantic dark fantasy Edward Scissorhands. He later found box office success in the adventure film Sleepy Hollow (1999), the swashbuckler film series Pirates of the Caribbean (2003–present), the fantasy films Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (2005) and Alice in Wonderland (2010), the animated comedy western Rango (2011) (in which he voiced the title character), and most recently Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald (2018). Depp has collaborated on nine films with director, producer and friend Tim Burton. Depp was inducted as a Disney Legend in 2015.[8] He has performed in numerous musical groups, including forming the rock supergroup Hollywood Vampires along with Alice Cooper and Joe Perry.

Hey everyone!  I'm currently working hard, learning new software for better visuals (preview at end of video), and continuing to break down info and evidence as much as I can.  But for now, I'm taking a quick break from working on my next series of videos to bring you a much needed update in the Johnny Depp vs Amber Heard case.

In this video I'll update you on several important motions and hearings over the past several months.  I'll also show evidence and witness testimony, some of which you likely have not seen yet.  Including Amber's dad threatening to kill Johnny over money, and texts between Amber's parents and Johnny in which they attempt to explain to him why Amber made up the story about abuse.  I'll put time stamps below in case you want to skip to those parts.

Thanks for watching!

Johnny DEPP v Amber HEARD (The Sun UK): The Appeal Hearing
https://youtu.be/07h7unV55NE


Johnny Depp has become a household name throughout his career, especially lately with the very public divorce with Amber Heard. This divorce is explosive in every way that is affecting their image, celebrity status, and finances. Johnny Depp has been in the public eye since his first experience in the acting world in 1984 when he made an appearance in Nightmare on Elm Street. This movie was just the start of his career, and he is seen as one the most prominent film stars of all time. Not only is he an actor, but he is a producer and musician as well. His resume is long and vast, but his marriage to Amber Heard has been a short and destructive ride. 
Johnny Depp's early life was not cut and dry with a happy little childhood. He was quiet and withdrawn with drug use and self-harm starting at the age of 12, and this pattern has set a stage that will only worsen and affect his behavior in all areas of his life. His life only got worse when his parents split up, giving Johnny the responsibility at 15 to collect the child support since he was the youngest. These events are creating the pattern of failing relationships and mental health that are currently bringing him down. 
Johnny Depp has had various romantic relationships, actresses, and models, and not all ended disastrously as his current legal battle. The relationship before Amber Heard was with Vanessa Paradis, his partner for 14 years, and they share two children. There are many speculated reasons for this split, and none of them are centering around any abuse claims. The reports are Vanessa's dislike of his mother, Depp became bored, and a potential relationship with Amber Heard. Their relationship did start the same period as Depp and Paradis's separation. Again I will say in this relationship of 14 years, and there were no allegations of abusive behavior. 
Amber Heard files for divorce under irreconcilable differences on May 23rd,2016, just three days after his mother's death, but this rocky marriage of 15 months has many sides to it. Heard was seeking spousal payments and claiming verbal and physical abuse but this divorce and court proceedings go beyond civilized and straight revenge starts. Depp's behavior has become erratic throughout their marriage, and his silent cries for help are finally being seen and heard.

Johnny DEPP v Amber HEARD (The Sun UK): The Appeal Hearing
https://youtu.be/07h7unV55NE


Johnny Depp has become a household name throughout his career, especially lately with the very public divorce with Amber Heard. This divorce is explosive in every way that is affecting their image, celebrity status, and finances. Johnny Depp has been in the public eye since his first experience in the acting world in 1984 when he made an appearance in Nightmare on Elm Street. This movie was just the start of his career, and he is seen as one the most prominent film stars of all time. Not only is he an actor, but he is a producer and musician as well. His resume is long and vast, but his marriage to Amber Heard has been a short and destructive ride. 
Johnny Depp's early life was not cut and dry with a happy little childhood. He was quiet and withdrawn with drug use and self-harm starting at the age of 12, and this pattern has set a stage that will only worsen and affect his behavior in all areas of his life. His life only got worse when his parents split up, giving Johnny the responsibility at 15 to collect the child support since he was the youngest. These events are creating the pattern of failing relationships and mental health that are currently bringing him down. 
Johnny Depp has had various romantic relationships, actresses, and models, and not all ended disastrously as his current legal battle. The relationship before Amber Heard was with Vanessa Paradis, his partner for 14 years, and they share two children. There are many speculated reasons for this split, and none of them are centering around any abuse claims. The reports are Vanessa's dislike of his mother, Depp became bored, and a potential relationship with Amber Heard. Their relationship did start the same period as Depp and Paradis's separation. Again I will say in this relationship of 14 years, and there were no allegations of abusive behavior. 
Amber Heard files for divorce under irreconcilable differences on May 23rd,2016, just three days after his mother's death, but this rocky marriage of 15 months has many sides to it. Heard was seeking spousal payments and claiming verbal and physical abuse but this divorce and court proceedings go beyond civilized and straight revenge starts. Depp's behavior has become erratic throughout their marriage, and his silent cries for help are finally being seen and heard. Depp denies all allegations and states he will not respond to lies about his personal life, but this is far from the end.

Amber Heard's career took a U-turn from success and celebrity when she declared herself a victim of violence from her ex-husband, actor Johnny Depp. The media opted to believe Heard despite the lack of evidence, and the major film studios followed suit. As a result of these allegations, Johnny Depp lost some of his most notable roles. You wouldn't believe how Hollywood is now abusing two of their most talented performers!

Johnny Depp finally speaks on how these court cases have affected Amber Heard's career. Let's just say he does not feel too bad for here. 

Here is a look at Amber Heard and all the things that she’s done to Johnny Depp, to fans, and more that have painted her in a more monstrous light that’ll no doubt end her career. How much longer do you think it’ll take for Hollywood to realize who Amber Heard truly is?

With the initial court date being pushed back, Johnny Depp and Amber Heard have been given some more time in order to gather more evidence for their individual cases. For quite some time, the two were firing evidence at each other in order to win in court. 

Ever since the recent release of the footage of the LAPD officers from the penthouse night of Amber Heard and Johnny Depp, things have not been looking all too bright for Amber Heard. Her team has been working tirelessly in order to back up her side, however Johnny Depp seems to have made the attempt to strike back.

Now it turns out that Amber Heard may have not written the statement or OP ED in accusations against Johnny Depp. This could another case of defamation or fraud. Let's break it down in today's video.

It seemed like the couple’s burning desire for each other turned into a burning dislike as quickly as it started. Five years after Amber Heard filed for divorce, the fight between the former couple is still ongoing. And even though the divorce had been finalized four years ago, the chaos that their marriage brought is far from over. But since the latest court hearing for the former couple’s defamation lawsuit will take place soon, there have been many major changes and happenings that just surfaced, and that includes a huge win for Johnny’s case. It seems like the Virginian judge handling their case is tired of Amber’s lies and is not willing to listen to her anymore. How did that happen? Well, it is a pretty detailed case but in this video, we’ll lay out everything you need to know. But before that, make sure to smash that subscribe button first and hit that notification bell for more updates. Let’s dive in!

Before everything else, let’s go back to the beginning of this case. Johnny and Amber first ignited a spark between them when they starred together at the 2011 comedy-drama film, The Rum Diary. This love story between the two had quickly travelled from screen to real life. Johnny was then sharing his life with partner Vanessa Paradis, a French actress and singer, whom he lived with for 14 years and whom he had two kids with, while Amber was with her then girlfriend Tasya van Ree. Shortly after the film’s release, the two broke off their current relationships and officially started dating. Their relationship was something you can describe as romantic and utterly beautiful. But today, it’s now one of the messiest in history. Amber Heard filed for divorce in 2016. Along the divorce filing was her request for a temporary restraining order against Johnny, accusing him of physically hurting her. Johnny, up to this day, vehemently denies the allegation. Even though the couple’s divorce was finalized in 2017, lawsuits have been made due to Amber’s concerning allegations against Depp. She also alleged that at the time of her filing for divorce, Johnny threw a phone at her which caused her to bruise her face, an accusation that Johnny denied, and investigators found false. Turns out, the photos were staged. Not so cool, Amber. Aside from this, the Aquaman actress also stressed that Johnny was hurtful towards his former lovers, which Johnny’s ex-wife and ex-fiancee proved false.

But despite the police’s information, news publication The Sun still called Johnny Depp a very bad name which angered the actor, causing him to file a libel lawsuit against the publication. Sadly enough, Johnny lost this lawsuit, which resulted in his career’s downfall as major production company Warner Bros. fired him from his role as Grindelwald in the upcoming third installment of the series Fantastic Beasts. Clearly, this broke Johnny’s heart. 

But even though her name became pretty big during this case, it is undeniable that Johnny’s name in the industry is a lot bigger. So, Amber started to lose her supporters’ trust, especially when more and more evidence against her was turning up, including the phone calls she made with Johnny admitting that she did hit him, her alleged affairs, and even her false claims that she donated her $7 million dollar divorce settlement to charity. Until now, Amber couldn’t provide any proof that she did donate her settlement money, which she publicly promised before. 

You might be wondering why Johnny Depp filed for a lawsuit in the state of Virginia when neither him nor Amber lives in the state. Virginia is one of just ten states that adhere to what’s known as the lex loci delicti rule, which is Latin for place of the wrong where the tort was committed. That’s defined as where the publication occurs. The Washington Post’s servers, the publication in which Amber released her Op Ed, are located in the state. Another reason why Johnny did not file his lawsuit in California is because of its strong Anti-SLAPP statute. Now, what is an anti-SLAPP law? These laws are intended to prevent people from using lawsuits, such as defamation suits, to intimidate people who are exercising their First Amendment rights.

Alright, so if you’ve been following this case, you know that amber heard is being accused of pooping in the bed she shared with johnny.  Depp accused amber heard of pooping in the bed as a prank after ambers 30th birthday party in 2016 after the two of them got in a fight. The housekeeper is the one that took the photos of the poop because she was supposedly so disgusted. Heard blamed it on the dog at the time, but according to the housekeeper, hilda vargas, it was clearly human feces.

How Amber Heard Destroyed Her Own Career

Amber Heard’s Lawyer EXPOSES Her For Ruining Johnny Depp

https://youtu.be/pZR2_v4UpgI

Amber Heard Officially FIRED From Aquaman 2 Role! (REACTIONS)

https://youtu.be/QBCEXSVjBrM

Amber Heard was extremely successful after divorcing Johnny Depp: she got cast in the
biggest movie franchise of her career - DC's 'Aquaman' - became the spokesperson of
cosmetics giant L'Oréal Paris, as well as American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) ambassador
for women's rights with a focus on gender-based violence.
So many people even claimed they have never heard about Amber until this infamous
divorce: “Had no idea who she was until that divorce. I didn’t even know that it was her who
played Mara!” - one fan said.
However, the tables have turned and now Amber Heard is finding that her career as an A-list
Hollywood actress might be over. She has reportedly been kicked from Aquaman 2 and she
is about to lose the contract with L'oreal Paris.
So what was the reason for all of these problematic events for Amber Heard? Apparently,
her well-planned strategy to ruin Johnny Depp’s life has been shattered. And now no one
believes that Amber is an innocent victim as Johnny showed in a court undeniable evidence
of Amber being an abuser (audio, text messages and so on).
Heard lost the appeal to dismiss Johnny Depp’s $50 million defamation lawsuit and we
learned that the Aquaman star could be facing up to 3 years of jail time if found guilty of
manipulating evidence against her then-husband. But even beyond the former couple’s
seemingly never-ending legal battle, Heard has come under a lot of fire after evidence
presented to the court as part of the lawsuit revealed that she’s physically and emotionally
harassed Depp while twisting the narrative in her favor and painting the Pirates of the
Caribbean actor as a domestic abuser.
In fact, the petition to remove her from Aquaman 2 recently reached a whopping 400,000
signatures and is on its way to passing the half-million threshold. This is essentially the same
kind of backlash and blacklisting that Depp had to endure a couple of years ago, so you can
see why fans of the legendary star are asking for justice with such fervency. And now,
according to a new report by Cosmic Book News, Warner Bros. has gone forward with firing
Heard from Aquaman 2 by buying out her contract.
Also there was one more petition against Amber Heard. “A liar and an abuser, a shame for
women,” begins one of two Change.org campaigns to remove Amber Heard, 33, from her
role as global spokesperson for cosmetics brand L’Oréal.
And yet, she has claimed in her court declaration countering ex-husband's $50 million
defamation suit against her that her career took a serious hit and she received death threats
that forced her to constantly keep on changing her contact details.
Here is what Amber declared in her motion to dismiss Johnny Depp’s lawsuit filed in Fairfax
County, Virginia Circuit Court:
""Following my highly-publicized separation from Johnny, I read accounts in the media
referring to me as a victim of domestic violence. In response, many people called me a liar

(without ever hearing my story). I was dropped from a global fashion brand's upcoming
campaign. I lost a part of a movie in which I had already been cast. People I have never met
or spoken to threatened me with violence. I received so many death threats I had to change
my phone number on a near-weekly basis.”
Isn’t it fair that her career might be over with Johnny as it started with him?
As reported by MEAWW earlier, although Heard's career in the entertainment industry began
in 2003 when she appeared in two music videos - Kenny Chesney's 'There Goes My Life'
and Eisley's 'I Wasn't Prepared,"" and went onto star in an array of TV shows and movies, her
career really took off in 2015 — the same year when she married Depp — when she had
prominent roles in four mainstream movies.


Now I want to know your opinion. Do you think Amber Heard’s career will be over soon as
she destroyed it on her own? Let me know what you think in the comments section down
below.

It just so happens to be that as the days get closer to their court date that the news that gets brought to light happens to be more and more shocking. In more recent news, it was shared that Amber Heard had a baby, and no we are not saying that she was hiding her pregnancy all this time, but regardless of how it happened, Amber Heard has a baby girl.

This video is like Cliff's notes and there's lots I had to leave out to keep this under twenty minutes (such as the dog smuggling, allegations/evidence of Amber cheating on Johnny, the staged cell phone incident with Rocky and IO,  Amber's mysterious disappearing bruises that many claim she faked, and of course her failure to pay the money she said she donated to charity).

Amber Heard knows how to get that money. She remains in the celebrity news and headlines as Aquaman 2 is set to make Amber Heard one of the highest paid actresses in Hollywood today. The Johnny Depp Amber Heard Court case continues and remains at the top of celeb news. 

With the initial court date being pushed back, Johnny Depp and Amber Heard have been given some more time in order to gather more evidence for their individual cases. For quite some time, the two were firing evidence at each other in order to win in court. 

Ever since the recent release of the footage of the LAPD officers from the penthouse night of Amber Heard and Johnny Depp, things have not been looking all too bright for Amber Heard. Her team has been working tirelessly in order to back up her side, however Johnny Depp seems to have made the attempt to strike back.

Amber Heard has filed a lawsuit against her ex-husband Johnny Depp, claiming that he abused her verbally and physically. Depp filed a defamation case against Heard after evidence of his innocence appeared in the form of a leaked tape from 2015 and a statement from her hairdresser. However, in an unforeseen turn of events, Heard might face not just millions of dollars in penalties, but also three years in jail.

Depp filed a defamation case against Heard after evidence of his innocence appeared in the form of a leaked tape from 2015 and a statement from her hairdresser. However, in an unforeseen turn of events, Heard might face not just millions of dollars in penalties, but also three years in jail.

Amber Heard publicly made a promise to give her $7m divorce settlement from Johnny Depp to charity but nothing was ever confirmed.

“Mr. Depp is most gratified by the Court’s decision,” Depp’s attorney Benhamin Chew told USA Today. 

His lawyers claim that Amber was lying about donating all of her divorce settlement to ACLU and the Children’s Hospital Los Angeles and may have cost him his libel case against a British newspaper in November 2020.

His attorney Andrew Caldecott claimed that Amber’s claim of donating money to charity was “calculated and manipulative lie” that “tipped the scales against Mr. Depp from the very beginning.”

Hey everyone!  Welcome back.

This new video and audio was first reported on by the Daily Mail.  It is from Amber's 2016 sworn deposition, taken just before Amber Heard dropped her domestic violence allegations against Johnny Depp.


Amber has repeatedly testified that she only hit Johnny one time during their relationship.  We already know that's a lie, but here is a very crucial point in her deposition, in which she willfully commits perjury, lying under oath about it.

This video is a clip which was excluded from the cut-up, edited and leaked recording by Johnny Depp’s team in January.  The full version was recorded by Johnny Depp and Amber Heard during their marriage (September 2015). The full recording is being used as evidence in the Johnny Depp v The Sun UK libel case. Depp decided to sue The Sun for publishing an article where they brand him a ‘wife-beater’, for abusing his then wife, Amber Heard. 

When the cut-up/edited 46 minute version leaked in January by Depp’s team, it was made to portray a certain narrative and was used as propaganda. It was leaked 6 months before the trial began and used to lead people and potential jurors to believe that it was somehow an official piece of evidence, which it was not. It was incomplete.

Now, they are getting huge media backlash, thanks to the negative comments against one of their lead actresses, Amber Heard. Before the whole Aquaman 2 filming even began, we all knew, and if you didn’t then you should listen to this next fact, that millions of fans were against Amber’s role reprisal in the upcoming Aquaman second installment that stars Jason Momoa and other huge stars such as Nicole Kidman, Patrick Wilson, Willem Defoe, and Randall Park. Such a big cast ensemble, and that alone proves that Warner Bros. can pay huge stars for their roles. Now, what’s up with recasting Amber Heard? You may remember that a huge number of supporters filed for a petition to be signed with the aim to request Warner Brothers to fire Amber from her role as Queen Mera, the same way they forced Johnny to leave Fantastic Beasts. However, even after garnering more than 1.6 million signatures, Warner Brothers still pushed through, having Amber reprise her role. A lot of fans were upset by this, and we mean UPSET. Everywhere you look on social media, there were mean comments about Amber, and sadly, about the upcoming Aquaman film itself. There’s no doubt that the first Aquaman directed by James Wan was a huge hit, and it deserved every inch of success because it’s aesthetically and cinematically beautiful in many, many aspects. Yet, during the promotion period, it had been noticeable that people were planning to not watch the movie and even campaign for others to boycott it too, in honor of their support for Johnny Depp, who has been let go from his role as Grindelwald in the Fantastic Beasts film series. Both movies are set to premiere in 2022, and both movies are going to be under Warner Brothers.

But what is keeping Warner Bros. head over heels for this actress who is currently dealing with a huge lawsuit in front of her, and a number of pieces of evidence against her proving that she is not all that she claims to be? With everything that’s going on in Johnny and Amber’s post-divorce chaos, it is indeed safe to say that Amber’s name is in the hot seat, and not in a positive way. Well, it turns out they are obviously risking it. Several people are slowing turning to Johnny’s side. So, in the middle of this all, fans can’t help but make their own bets on who would be the suitable replacement for her cast as Queen Mera. There are tons of different actresses that would fit the role, but it seems like in the last few months while this situation against casting Amber is happening, fans’ eyes are falling on Emilia Clarke.

But why do we think Emilia would be the perfect person to play Queen Mera? Well, there’s a number of reasons, from rekindling her romance with Game of Thrones co-star Jason Momoa. Stay tuned because we are about to enumerate all the reasons for you. But first, make sure to hit that subscribe button and smash that notification bell for more updates. So, here are some of the biggest reasons why Emilia Clarke is the best female celeb to replace Amber Heard in Aquaman 2.

1. She is one of the biggest and most celebrated female stars today
Widely known as Daenerys Targaryen, 

2. Fans would love to see Jason Momoa and Emilia Clarke back as an on screen pair
It is never easy to replace a cast member, especially a well-loved cast member, in a film’s second installment. However, if Warner Bros. did this decision as easily with Johnny Depp, considering how it might agitate his fans, then it must also be an easy feat for the production company to replace Amber Heard as well especially in the midst of her. While it is never easy with the fans (but in this case of course it is) when an actor is replaced in a franchise, it may go down better with viewers when they see Jason and Emilia reunite as an on-screen pair. The biggest reason why Emilia Clarke is a good replacement for Amber Heard in ‘Aquaman 2’ is that she is a fan-favorite since her past role with Jason Momoa.

3. Emilia’s siren-like physique can surely rock the Queen Mera suit
Amidst this chaos between Johnny Depp and Amber Heard, fans are already eyeing Emilia Clarke as the latter’s replacement in Aquaman 2.

But given that all these will remain merely fantasies for fans, we’ll just wait for 2022 and see how Aquaman 2 goes. That’s all for today, we hope you enjoyed that video, and if you did, make sure you like, subscribe, and hit that notification bell for more videos like this.

Mais depuis sa rencontre avec la sulfureuse Amber Heard, cet impressionnant et formidable parcours a semblé être sur le point de se terminer prématurément, et certains voudraient même que la légende de Johnny Depp ne soit remise aux oubliettes.
Selon cette dernière, le capitaine Jack Sparrow ne serait qu’un monstre cogneur de femmes !Si beaucoup en doutent, d’autres, croient fermement ces allégations ! Aujourd'hui nous vous proposons une vidéo exceptionnelle sur la terrible descente aux enfers de Johnny Depp.

Approximately one month after they married, Heard threw multiple objects at him, including two vodka bottles that severed his finger. He said in court documents that the attack started after he told her she'd have to sign a prenup. 

And this video is part of the deposition of the 30M lawsuit against his ex lawyers. Because the attorney Bryan Freedman, brought the injury up because Bloom’s law firm had prepared the post-nup agreement that Heard was asked to sign the night before the fight, as Depp claimed.

He also stated multiple times in these court documents  that he lied to protect her, saying that he had cut his own finger by accident.


Here a few things you need to know:

Amber changed the history behind the incident multiple times.

I. First she claimed she was in UK, on the phone with Johnny while he threw a punch at some glass, severing his finger

IV. She admits she was in Australia, but didn't throw a bottle or anything at him. https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/5835867-Amber-Heard-Motion-to-Dismiss.html


V. And recently, in a record obtained by Daily Mail, she admitted that she ""never meant to hurt him"" in Australia. Heard repeatedly says she didn't did it on purpose while crying and afraid she'll lose him. All this happening while doctors were searching for Depp's finger in what looked like a crime scene, just a few hours after the Incident.

Elon Musk just keeps getting dragged back into the Johnny Depp Amber Heard celeb drama. Elon Musk, Johnny Depp and Amber Heard are back on the frontlines of celebrity news. Amber Heard just had a baby girl and rumors are swirling on who the baby's father is. 

Many are saying it is Johnny Depp. Some are saying is Elon Musk himself. Elon Musk and Amber Heard are past lovers and rumors are swirling that Elon Musk paid Amber Heard's 7 million donation to the ACLU back in 2016. So these two have a history together.

But no public statements have been made in this regard by either Elon Musk, Johnny Depp or Amber Heard. So no one knows for sure yet. In this video, we breakdown the story in detail. This celebrity drama goes down while the Johnny Depp Amber Heard civil court case rages on.

With the initial court date being pushed back, Johnny Depp and Amber Heard have been given some more time in order to gather more evidence for their individual cases. For quite some time, the two were firing evidence at each other in order to win in court. 

Ever since the recent release of the footage of the LAPD officers from the penthouse night of Amber Heard and Johnny Depp, things have not been looking all too bright for Amber Heard. Her team has been working tirelessly in order to back up her side, however Johnny Depp seems to have made the attempt to strike back.

Johnny Depp Reacts. | Celebrity Craze

Johnny Depp and Amber Heard are back on the frontlines of celebrity news. Amber Heard just had a baby girl and rumors are swirling on who the baby's father is. Many are saying it is Johnny Depp. But no public statements have been made in this regard by either Johnny Depp or Amber Heard. So no one knows for sure yet. In this video, we breakdown the story in detail. This celebrity drama goes down while the Johnny Depp Amber Heard civil court case rages on.  

With the initial court date being pushed back, Johnny Depp and Amber Heard have been given some more time in order to gather more evidence for their individual cases. For quite some time, the two were firing evidence at each other in order to win in court. 

Ever since the recent release of the footage of the LAPD officers from the penthouse night of Amber Heard and Johnny Depp, things have not been looking all too bright for Amber Heard. Her team has been working tirelessly in order to back up her side, however Johnny Depp seems to have made the attempt to strike back.

Did Amber Heard just get booted for Aquaman 2? This would be great news to Johnny Depp and Aquaman fans around the world. The #FireAmberHeard movement is going strong. It seems the Aquaman 2 director, James Wan, does not even want Amber Heard in the movie. 

It seems like everyone is turning against Amber Heard. The Johnny Depp Amber Heard legal battle is still at the forefront of celebrity news. 

With the initial court date being pushed back, Johnny Depp and Amber Heard have been given some more time in order to gather more evidence for their individual cases. For quite some time, the two were firing evidence at each other in order to win in court. 

Ever since the recent release of the footage of the LAPD officers from the penthouse night of Amber Heard and Johnny Depp, things have not been looking all too bright for Amber Heard. Her team has been working tirelessly in order to back up her side, however Johnny Depp seems to have made the attempt to strike back.

Such as “why is this going this far?”, “why hasn’t Johnny Depp been cleared yet?”, “why would Amber Heard do these things?”, “Why did Johnny not come forward sooner about this?” and so on and so forth. But while we don’t have all the answers to those questions, we are able to look back in hindsight and see if Johnny Depp tried to warn us about all that was going on with his relationship with Amber Heard.

Fans of movie star Johnny Depp have demanded their idol’s name be cleared, after his ex-wife Amber Heard apparently admitted to hitting and throwing objects at him in a leaked audio tape. Heard has accused Depp of domestic abuse.

In an audio confession leaked to the Daily Mail, Heard admits to hitting Depp with pans, pots and vases. The conversation took place during a therapy session in 2015, as the tinseltown pair attempted to save their tumultuous marriage.

“I'm sorry that I didn't, uh, uh, hit you across the face in a proper slap, but I was hitting you, it was not punching you. Babe, you're not punched,” Heard tells Depp, attempting to explain a violent outburst the night before

The lawsuit against Johnny Depp has dragged on far too long. As Depp attempts to repair his reputation in the middle of all the charges leveled against him by his ex-wife Amber, despite several pieces of evidence pointing to Amber as the true abuser, she has yet managed to gain the support of the court and even Hollywood. Many celebrities have come to both of their aids to support their friends. People like Jason Momoa, Emilia Clarke, Sia, and more have started to speak up and share their experiences with the two celebrities and what they thought of the cam footage that was released by the LAPD! Who do you think is in the right here? And will this lawsuit ever find an end?

Johnny Depp has simply had enough now! Earlier Johnny said that he has not been hurt like this before as allegations struck a major blow to his reputation and mental health, but as soon as Amber Heard started targeting his kids, then Johnny had to put a stop for her! And so do we, emotionally blackmail his kids is just WRONG! 

First of all, then Johnny has since the start of the controversy said that Amber Heard has made several false and unproven reports about his extravagant spending, his legal disputes with his former managers and a Rolling Stone profile which portrayed him as a debauched, self-indulgent and narcissistic. She has also said that Johnny would be ready to fight till his demise if anyone targets his children. Anyways, Amber seems to have forgotten that, since she herself has just started targeting Johnny's kids. 
Johnny himself doesn’t even hide the fact. Once, he even said that he would bite off the nose of anyone who nears his kids.

Jason Momoa is a name that is buzzing and has been buzzing in the world of showbiz for quite some time. In fact, when Aquaman was released earlier in the year 2018, he was the only talk of Hollywood! Following that, he was given the opportunity to play a variety of roles in different movies leaving us to wonder when we would see this heartthrob on the big screens again!

Due to Aquaman’s major success, soon after its release, the second sequel to the movie was announced to be premiered in the year 2022. Unfortunately, with the Me Too movement targeting so many A-listers, one of the cast members was accused of being a part of this bandwagon. Any guesses on who fell off the wagon and joined in amongst the list of abusers? Yes, it was Amber Heard!

Amber Heard has been making headlines regularly for almost 2 years now, especially after her divorce from Johnny Depp. Initially, people assumed her to be the poor victim in the chaotic scenario she had going on with Johnny Depp. At one point, we were pretty convinced that she was the victim after she posted her pictures of the scars that she had obtained due to being a victim of domestic violence. 
 
What were Amber’s claims?

Amber Heard proved to be the biggest victim of the year, with her constant rants on social media as well as her claiming Johnny Depp to be an evil man with anger issues. She kept throwing out lies until one day Depp was forced to sue her, hence causing the famous chaotic court case to make repeated headlines.

How did Ambers Claims backfire?
 
Johnny Depp was proven innocent to his ex-wife’s claims after a leaked conversation between the two was released, proving that in fact, it was Johnny Depp who was being victimized. This surely didn’t save the mess he was in but made the likes of big platforms such as Disney apologize to him for believing the allegations.

How did this news worsen?

The Me Too movement was trending and each day a new celeb was being called out for inappropriate behaviour of misconduct with the co-workers, especially the female ones. Due to this being embedded in the minds of all, Depp was the most likely candidate to get abuser-bashed for his immoral actions.

Due to her alleged accusations, Johnny Depp’s career was quite miserable. In fact, the production teams that loved working with his massive talent started to reject his role in the movies. And all this was due to the fault of Amber and her bunch of lies. Imagine not having Jack Sparrow in the next Pirates of the Caribbean sequel!

Was Momoa and Heard compatible in real life as much as they seemed on screen?

Rumor has it that the Momoa and Heard were not as compatible as they seemed on the screen. With them being actors from two different worlds, it is sure to be quite a clash in the studios. But others state that they were actually good together since they were complete opposites and that opposites attract. Even though they seem great together on the red carpet, always having fun, the truth behind this fact is still left unknown!

Would Momoa’s word and stance on this scenario change the fate of who plays the role of Mera?

Most probably, yes. Without Jason, there is no Aquaman. In fact, the entire success behind Aquaman was 90% due to Jason Momoa’s efforts in making the storyline as lively. Without him, reaching this milestone would have been highly impossible. On a serious note, it’s highly possible that rather than risking their biggest asset, Warner Bros. would not sacrifice their king for the sake of Amber! clevver news celebrity news amber heard aquaman 2 johnny depp elon musk amber heard fight video top 10

This video includes the full unedited, uncut, uninterrupted 2 hour recording made my Johnny Depp and Amber Heard during their marriage (September 2015). This recording is being used as evidence in the Johnny Depp v The Sun UK libel case. Depp decided to sue The Sun for publishing an article where they brand him a ‘wife-beater’, for abusing his then wife, Amber Heard. 

When the cut-up/edited 46 minute version leaked in January by Depp’s team, it was made to portray a certain narrative and was used as propaganda. It was leaked 6 months before the trial began and used to lead people and potential jurors to believe that it was somehow an official piece of evidence, which it was not. It was incomplete.

According to Amber Heard’s , Johnny Depp stateside 50 million defamation against Amber Heard should be dismissed. The UK judgment should be considered and regard should be given to the op-ed publications too, Depp did commit domestic violence against Heard repeatedly which resulted in Amber Heard threatened for her life and causing a huge trauma. 

This declares a supplemental plea. For the matter of , Johnny Depp cannot win on any of his claims, thereby Depp’s complaint against Heard should be dismissed as its whole.  This appeared in the Fairfax county docket in a filling on the 13th of April. 

Now, this matter has been brought forward from April 11, 2020, Amber Heard has apparently requested for the hearing which is to be held on the 28th of May, in front of Penney Azcarate. He was assigned the case by Chief judge Bruce White.

As Amber Heard was unsuccessful in shutting Johnny’s Depp’s suit in the past, this time she is trying to see far ahead with the new strategy. At the moment, Heard has nothing to lose and help her gain a sure-footed move in the US . 

Most of the factual information that was precluded cannot allow Johnny Depp to relitigate them. These statements cannot be claimed false either, nor can they be claimed actionable by Johnny Depp, this falls under the Virginia Defamation .  Therefore his claims are obstructed due to the and the plea filing states. 

In this case, both the cases were different, one was defamation and the other was a case. The main difference between the two is that of the written word and of the spoken word. When it comes to Amber Heard, she left no stone unturned to prove Johnny wrong, and that’s she has done both of them. She has also on many occasions spoken about Johnny and the domestic violence she faced because of him. 

One of the new pieces of evidence that were revealed later is the Bodycam footage from the cops that Amber Heard had called on Johnny Depp. This bodycam is from the rampage that occurred in May 2016. In the , many of Amber Heard’s allies and friends have given evidence from the incident. 

They said that Johnny Depp hurled a phone at her face and had also thrashed the penthouse’s kitchen. What Amber Heard’s have claimed to be depictions of the damage done by Johnny Depp are quite different from what the police had observed and addressed.

Amber Heard’s friends had dialed 9-1-1 mistakenly twice, the first cops to arrive have given some new depositions since the last month, claiming that they had seen no signs of vandalism, injuries, or crime scene. 

Johnny Depp’s attorney addressed this cover-up and countered Amber Heard’s allegation the night of the rampage, a chaotic, messy crime had been reported by Amber Heard and her allies although the LAPD’s bodycam proved the testimony wrong, he had stated. 

This leads us to another point which is that Amber Heard has made a lot of cover-ups. The rampage night was not the only cover-up by Amber Heard, she has exaggerated and on many occasions made false claims. 

The bodycam is the lead that tells us that Amber Heard has been provided by her team with all the stories.The UK case can be noted as having a few flawed logic in the verdict, the appeal had been denied partly, the reason being that Johnny’s team failed to present the evidence early. 

This incident has always been highlighted by Amber Heard and she has voiced her views on the same, saying that Johnny Depp was in a rage, beat her, and tore the house apart. When the police arrived, she didn’t look like she was assaulted nor did the house look ‘torn apart. 

The dismissal is a possibility however shocking it is, however, Depp’s team can go about it with the new set of evidence to fight the .  

Whenever the audience speculates and forms their opinions on the legal battle between Amber Heard and Johnny Depp that’s when a twist hits, this seems like a loop. 

The date for the main defamation date is in April 2022, this again leaves us on such an open note. If the two reach a mutual settlement, then we may see an abrupt end to the entire situation clevver news yellowflash 2 information overload adam waldman thatumbrellaguy

But what did really go down over there? Are the Virginian judges actually considering this move by Amber’s legal team? Let’s find out in this video. But before anything else, make sure first to hit that subscribe button and smash that notification bell for more updates on this. So, let’s dive in! 

Being a celebrity is a tricky thing, as your personal relationships can become very public affairs. Amber Heard and Johnny Depp know this all too well, as the former couple is consistently making headlines due to their ongoing legal situation. Amber Heard and Johnny Depp have been duking it out in court for years, and are showing no signs of slowing down. It has been an excruciatingly long time since Johnny had filed a suit against Amber Heard’s team after his former wife wrote details about their previous and failed marriage in an Op Ed article at The Washington Post, which then ended Johnny’s chances of getting back on his most famous Disney film franchise, the Pirates of the Caribbean series, and basically ruined his entire career. Even though the article was not directly mentioning Johnny’s name in it, it was obviously pertaining to him as Amber said, detailed, and explained that she was physically maltreated, and in which she spoke about the treatment of women in cases such as hers. So, in March of 2019, the 57 year old actor took action and filed a lawsuit of $50 million against her, for things said over the aforementioned article in the Washington Post. The suit said that Amber ""is not a product of domestic maltreatment, she is a perpetrator,"" and denied that Johnny ever hurt her physically. At the time, Depp's lawyer called the article an ""overuse of the women empowerment movement"". And instead, the suit said that her words were part of an ""elaborate stunt to generate positive publicity"" for the actress. And then of course the #NeverForget $7 million dollar’s worth of divorce settlement she got from her wealthy ex husband, Johnny, which she vowed to donate to charity but who knows what really happened to it now? A Virginian judge scolded Amber Heard for quote “wasting the court’s time”. 

But anyway, after all these, you might think she's done. But nope, it seems like the end is a long way ahead yet for Amber’s eyes. For the second time a few months ago, Amber tried to have her case with Johnny dismissed, pulling out her “he lost the case with The Sun card”, which was honestly a little low. Not cool, Amber. You may remember that before this lawsuit with Amber, Johnny had already fought for a lawsuit against new publisher The Sun, after the company called him a very bad name. 

 And after that, she then surprised the whole world with her own baby! It was born out of surrogate, and yes, no one knows who the father is, but it may actually be an important twist in the hearings to come. For the third time! Wow, being inside Amber Heard’s head might be tough. 

This latest update comes to us from Court House News, which revealed how the proceedings in court went down yesterday. One of Amber Heard’s lawyers attempted to use the verdict in the U.K. as an indication that she shouldn’t be hit with a lawsuit. Obviously Depp’s team has clapped back, so it remains to be seen if the third attempt for the case to be dismissed is successful. According to the CourtHouse News, “An attorney for actress Amber Heard on Thursday asked a Virginia judge to embrace findings from a U.K. court that Johnny Depp, Heard's ex husband.

Johnny’s lawyers have challenged back, once again, stating that the cases cannot be connected. Depp's lawyer, Ben Chew of Brown Rudnick, characterized the motion for dismissal as futile and frivolous. However, after trying to dismiss her lawsuit one too many times, Ben Chow also called out for Amber Heard's legal team to halt before Johnny asks them to be abided by law, pushing for Heard and her team to receive consequences for their repeated claims in court. 

What upsets most fans is the fact that Amber will still star alongside Jason Momoa in the latest DCEU installment of Aquaman, despite many supporters’ request for Warner Brothers to do otherwise.

What about you? Will you be watching Aquaman 2? Do you think it's fair for Johnny’s famous case to be dismissed because of the lost libel case years ago in a different continent?  See you next time!

While some celebrities prefer living a quiet life away from the public, others just have so many scandals following them. In this video, we are going to talk about Johnny Depp and Amber Heard, who have been on each other’s throats ever since they split up and how Amber Heard might be facing jail time for one mistake she made in all this.

With the initial court date being pushed back, Johnny Depp and Amber Heard have been given some more time in order to gather more evidence for their individual cases. For quite some time, the two were firing evidence at each other in order to win in court. 

Ever since the recent release of the footage of the LAPD officers from the penthouse night of Amber Heard and Johnny Depp, things have not been looking all too bright for Amber Heard. Her team has been working tirelessly in order to back up her side, however Johnny Depp seems to have made the attempt to strike back.

Johnny Depp. He's someone whom many people are discussing for the sole reason of the years-long court case between him and his ex-wife Amber Heard. That case and everything that has come with it has taken away a lot from Depp outside of just time and money for court costs. Many would argue that it's costing him his career due to many movie studios refusing to hire him despite evidence stating that he's not the person Amber Heard claims he is. And now, another person from Pirates of the Caribbean has come forward to defend Johnny. We'll break it down for you. Be sure to like the video and subscribe to the channel!

The Aquaman star, 34, read a statement outside the High Court where she has accused Depp, 57, of attacking her 14 times over three years.

Wearing a black skirt and top, Heard said she just ""wanted to move on with my life"" and described her pain at the ""traumatic and intimate details"" of her life being ""broadcast to the entire world"". 

The actress also said she stands by her testimony as she thanked her legal team, police and the ""outpouring"" of support from around the world.

It comes after Depp earlier gave out handwritten notes thanking fans for supporting him during the high-profile case.

The brown envelopes contained a black and white bandana similar to the one he has been sporting during the case.

As the seas are starting to calm down after the dubious Johnny Depp vs Amber Heard trial from 2020, it is now clear to see that Johnny Depp was the victim and big studios are reportedly interested in the actor once again. Disney might have just rehired Johnny Depp to return as Jack Sparrow in Pirates of the Caribbean 6 movie. It is alleged that Walt Disney is standing firmly behind Johnny Depp in his legal battle against his ex-wife Amber Heard despite the company distancing themselves from the actor last year and “blocking him” from returning as a cameo in The Pirates of The Caribbean reboot starring none other than Margot Robbie. But is Johnny actually going to be rehired, or is it all just speculation? And will Johnny's life be back to normal once the whole Amber Heard lawsuit blows over or will this be stuck on him and affect his career until he retires?

Amber Heard remains at the frontline of celebrity news due to his ongoing legal battles with ex husband Johnny Depp. The Johnny Depp Amber Heard court case has gotten ugly for many reasons.

While some celebrities prefer living a quiet life away from the public, others just have so many scandals following them. In this video, we are going to talk about Johnny Depp and Amber Heard, who have been on each other’s throats ever since they split up and how Amber Heard might be facing jail time for one mistake she made in all this.

With the initial court date being pushed back, Johnny Depp and Amber Heard have been given some more time in order to gather more evidence for their individual cases. For quite some time, the two were firing evidence at each other in order to win in court. 

Ever since the recent release of the footage of the LAPD officers from the penthouse night of Amber Heard and Johnny Depp, things have not been looking all too bright for Amber Heard. Her team has been working tirelessly in order to back up her side, however Johnny Depp seems to have made the attempt to strike back.

Raven Symoné noticed Amber Heard in a parking lot while she was charging her Tesla. They both were charging, when she noticed Amber behaving strangely. Raven hints at Amber Heard being the problem and Johnny Depp being the victim. I am very curious if Raven is on Depp's side; It appears she trolled Amber Heard in this video. 
The best part is she took a photo with Amber.

Amber seen SCREAMING!,"PLEASE SUBSCRIBE:

Raven Symoné noticed Amber Heard in a parking lot while she was charging her Tesla. They both were charging, when she noticed Amber behaving strangely. Raven hints at Amber Heard being the problem and Johnny Depp being the victim. I am very curious if Raven is on Depp's side; It appears she trolled Amber Heard in this video. 
The best part is she took a photo with Amber.

This judge is done with Amber Heard and her lawyer. We got the whole transcript over here in regards to the Johnny Depp lawsuit. We are going to go the most relevant and important parts where she talks about the Johnny Depp and the evidence against her. 

We will start to see how Amber Heard is going lose this court case. This clearly shows that Amber Heard is lying. You will hear what the judge had to say to Amber Heard. It is the newest piece of celebrity news.

While some celebrities prefer living a quiet life away from the public, others just have so many scandals following them. In this video, we are going to talk about Johnny Depp and Amber Heard, who have been on each other’s throats ever since they split up and how Amber Heard might be facing jail time for one mistake she made in all this.

With the initial court date being pushed back, Johnny Depp and Amber Heard have been given some more time in order to gather more evidence for their individual cases. For quite some time, the two were firing evidence at each other in order to win in court. 

Ever since the recent release of the footage of the LAPD officers from the penthouse night of Amber Heard and Johnny Depp, things have not been looking all too bright for Amber Heard. Her team has been working tirelessly in order to back up her side, however Johnny Depp seems to have made the attempt to strike back.

Amber Heard has been giving a sneak peek of her prep for Aquaman 2 for a while now. The actress has been intensively training for her revival as Mera.
She’s gotten back on sets today for the shoot but the news hasn’t gone down well with Johnny Depp and his fans. However, Twitter is witnessing #JusticeForJohnnyDepp trending with over 10K tweets in a few minutes after her revival was announced.

Johnny Depp's fans are trending #JusticeforJohnnyDepp as they are expressing anger over the same studio that fired the actor and is continuing to employ Amber Heard. Johnny, who was expected to return as Gellert Grindelwald in Fantastic Beasts 3, sadly came under scrutiny recently during his highly publicised divorce from Amber Heard. Johnny was accused of domestic abuse. Although he denied the allegation, he lost a high profile case against a newspaper who dubbed him as a wife beater. Due to allegations against him, Warner Bros asked him to step down from the role as Grindelwald in The Fantastic Beasts franchise. Johnny lost another most prominent role as Captain Jack Sparrow in Disney's Pirates of the Caribbean. On the other hand, Amber Heard began filming for Aquaman 2. Now Johnny's fans have expressed anger over the same and want justice to be served for the actor. The online hate for Amber Heard’s removal from Aquaman 2 is largely based on various unproven allegations that have been levelled against her over the years.

While some celebrities prefer living a quiet life away from the public, others just have so many scandals following them. In this video, we are going to talk about Johnny Depp and Amber Heard, who have been on each other’s throats ever since they split up and how Amber Heard might be facing jail time for one mistake she made in all this.

With the initial court date being pushed back, Johnny Depp and Amber Heard have been given some more time in order to gather more evidence for their individual cases. For quite some time, the two were firing evidence at each other in order to win in court. 

Ever since the recent release of the footage of the LAPD officers from the penthouse night of Amber Heard and Johnny Depp, things have not been looking all too bright for Amber Heard. Her team has been working tirelessly in order to back up her side, however Johnny Depp seems to have made the attempt to strike back.

Amber Heard’s Father’s HORRIFIC Threat to Johnny Depp!

https://youtu.be/r1vQod8BJk4

One of the biggest Hollywood debacles going on right now is the rather ugly
divorce proceedings between Johnny Depp and Amber Heard. Still, it is pretty
difficult to say who’s right and who’s wrong, but it seems like Amber Heard is
far from winning. There is so much evidence against her. The whole world
considers her as a liar and now her father has been accused of threatening to
shoot Johnny Depp. How far can Amber Heard go for the money? And is it true
that her father was ab*sive towards her when she was a kid?
Make sure you stay till the end to figure out the real reason for Amber Heard’s
father wanting to kill Johnny Depp.
But before we start with Amber Heard’s father threatens to kill Johnny Depp,
let’s got back to 2020 to see the whole picture which shows that being agressive
and violent towards people is not something which happens for the first time in
Amber Heard’s family. Back in 2020 the actress revealed to a UK court that she
previously witnessed violence at home growing up and said that Johnny Depp
“makes dad look like a saint when he falls off the wagon”.
Amber Heard told the court that her father, David, “struggled with alcohol and
drug abuse issues his whole life.” “He is an addict and an alcoholic and he was
very violent but I love him very much,” she said.
Amber Heard said she reached out to her mom after one of Johnny Depp’s
alleged benders in March 2015 because she wanted “someone to talk to who
might understand first hand how it was.”
“My father was violent to my mother growing up,” Amber Heard told the court.
“They loved each other but he was very violent to her until the end ... she
passed away.”
Amber Heard told her mom the “Pirates of the Caribbean” actor was a
“madman” - but insisted he was not physically abusive with her. “It’s ok mom.
He’s not being violent with me. He’s just even raging in general,” she wrote.
The actress, however, denied in court that she was being truthful with her
mother, saying she “just didn’t want her to tell my dad.”

“I felt safe to tell my mother, but I didn’t know how my dad would react,” she
said. “I had never been in this situation before and I didn’t know if he would
react violently ... to Johnny.” And now. Here we are. It seems like Amber
Heard was absolutely right about her father because recently he was being
agressive towards Johnny Depp and there’s a witness who revealed the entire
situation. But before we start, make sure you hit the subscribe button to knoow
the most interesting information about celebrities’ lives.
So, how it all started. When it seemed as though things couldn’t get any worse,
there were some official reports saying that Johnny Depp was apparently being
threatened by Amber’s father, David Heard. According to a legal document, the
threats were overheard by a witness via a phone conversation in which her dad
made accusations that Johnny Depp was ruining his daughter’s career. Amber’s
father said about Johnny: “That f**ing piece of s**t is f**ing me too because
I’m supposed to get 10% of the money and without it I can’t produce the movie
I was gunna make!...He is ruining my baby girl’s career and blackballing her in
Hollywood”. Seems like the money is the biggest reason for the Heards to
attack Johnny Depp back and forth. The threat only seemed to escalate further
when guns were brought into the conversation, with David saying: “And when I
get to him I’m going to beat the s**t out of him...I’m from Texas, and men
from Texas carry 45’s and Johnny is going to meet the f**ing end of mine!”
So, what was going on there and who was the witness? According to the report,
David Killackey, the owner of Performance Allison Transmissions who worked
on both Amber and Johnny‘s classic cars, claimed that Amber became abusive
towards him and that her father made “death threats” towards Johnny in a phone
call.
...
And now I want to know your opinion. What do you think about Amber and her
family being agressive towards Johnny? Do you think is it possible that any
word or action will be taken against Amber Heard’s father? Let me know your
opinion in the comments section down below.

Amber Heard’s Father’s HORRIFIC Threat to Johnny Depp!

https://youtu.be/r1vQod8BJk4

One of the biggest Hollywood debacles going on right now is the rather ugly
divorce proceedings between Johnny Depp and Amber Heard. Still, it is pretty
difficult to say who’s right and who’s wrong, but it seems like Amber Heard is
far from winning. There is so much evidence against her. The whole world
considers her as a liar and now her father has been accused of threatening to
shoot Johnny Depp. How far can Amber Heard go for the money? And is it true
that her father was ab*sive towards her when she was a kid?
Make sure you stay till the end to figure out the real reason for Amber Heard’s
father wanting to kill Johnny Depp.
But before we start with Amber Heard’s father threatens to kill Johnny Depp,
let’s got back to 2020 to see the whole picture which shows that being agressive
and violent towards people is not something which happens for the first time in
Amber Heard’s family. Back in 2020 the actress revealed to a UK court that she
previously witnessed violence at home growing up and said that Johnny Depp
“makes dad look like a saint when he falls off the wagon”.
Amber Heard told the court that her father, David, “struggled with alcohol and
drug abuse issues his whole life.” “He is an addict and an alcoholic and he was
very violent but I love him very much,” she said.
Amber Heard said she reached out to her mom after one of Johnny Depp’s
alleged benders in March 2015 because she wanted “someone to talk to who
might understand first hand how it was.”
“My father was violent to my mother growing up,” Amber Heard told the court.
“They loved each other but he was very violent to her until the end ... she
passed away.”
Amber Heard told her mom the “Pirates of the Caribbean” actor was a
“madman” - but insisted he was not physically abusive with her. “It’s ok mom.
He’s not being violent with me. He’s just even raging in general,” she wrote.
The actress, however, denied in court that she was being truthful with her
mother, saying she “just didn’t want her to tell my dad.”

“I felt safe to tell my mother, but I didn’t know how my dad would react,” she
said. “I had never been in this situation before and I didn’t know if he would
react violently ... to Johnny.” And now. Here we are. It seems like Amber
Heard was absolutely right about her father because recently he was being
agressive towards Johnny Depp and there’s a witness who revealed the entire
situation. But before we start, make sure you hit the subscribe button to knoow
the most interesting information about celebrities’ lives.
So, how it all started. When it seemed as though things couldn’t get any worse,
there were some official reports saying that Johnny Depp was apparently being
threatened by Amber’s father, David Heard. According to a legal document, the
threats were overheard by a witness via a phone conversation in which her dad
made accusations that Johnny Depp was ruining his daughter’s career. Amber’s
father said about Johnny: “That f**ing piece of s**t is f**ing me too because
I’m supposed to get 10% of the money and without it I can’t produce the movie
I was gunna make!...He is ruining my baby girl’s career and blackballing her in
Hollywood”. Seems like the money is the biggest reason for the Heards to
attack Johnny Depp back and forth. The threat only seemed to escalate further
when guns were brought into the conversation, with David saying: “And when I
get to him I’m going to beat the s**t out of him...I’m from Texas, and men
from Texas carry 45’s and Johnny is going to meet the f**ing end of mine!”
So, what was going on there and who was the witness? According to the report,
David Killackey, the owner of Performance Allison Transmissions who worked
on both Amber and Johnny‘s classic cars, claimed that Amber became abusive
towards him and that her father made “death threats” towards Johnny in a phone
call.
...
And now I want to know your opinion. What do you think about Amber and her
family being agressive towards Johnny? Do you think is it possible that any
word or action will be taken against Amber Heard’s father? Let me know your
opinion in the comments section down below.

From being Hollywood’s favorite couple to being one of the worst and most toxic couples to be in the spotlight, Amber Heard and Johnny Depp have been on the front page of news outlets for years now after Amber filed for divorce claiming Johnny was an abuser. What started as a romantic and cute relationship quickly turned violent and messy. But now 5 years after the initial divorce announcement, the couple is still in ongoing court battles and lawsuits even though the original divorce was actually concluded.

However recently, just a few weeks prior to their next defamation case court hearing, many things have started to come to light and there have been lots of changes in the situation. Which includes a massive win for Johnny Depp, apart from the most recent one where bodycam footage confirmed Amber was lying. This time it seems the Virginia judge who handles their case has had enough of Amber’s lies and doesn’t want to hear a single more. But what happened for her to reach this point?

Welcome back to the channel, Schaikers, Derek Van Schaik here.
Amber Heard is the now 34 year old Hollywood actress who played in The Rum Diary, The Ward, and how could any of us forget her smash hit I Do..Until I Don’t, and as you all know, the now 57 year old Johnny Depp is a pirate.

Amber and Johnny got married on February 3, 2015, Amber filed for divorce on May 23, 2016, and the divorce was finalized on January 13, 2017. However, both Johnny and Amber claimed spousal abuse during the divorce hearings and Depp is now suing gossip magazines for libel, slander, and defamation for perpetuating the story which greatly negatively impact his acting career.  So we’re going to break down Amber Heard’s body language during her intense deposition, along with their recorded conversations, to find out whether these accusations against Johnny Depp appear to be true or false.

Hey everyone!  This is the first video I've ever made for YouTube so I know the quality isn't the best, but I feel the content is solid.

Oddly enough, this video doesn't, directly, have much to do with Johnny Depp and Amber Heard, but rather a friend and witness of Ambers.  Basically, I wanted to share information that isn't really being talked about.  Yet, it seems like important information.

I'm not trying to sway anyone's opinion.  I know minds are mostly made up at this point, but figured everyone would at least like to be operating with the most information possible.

The domestic abuse scandal between Johnny Depp and his ex-wife Amber Heard has been making headlines for roughly 3 years now. Up until now, all odds have been in favor of Amber Heard however, there are still some people out there that believe Johnny Depp is innocent of Ambers assault claims. And if the LAPD footage that is making rounds on social media is anything to go by, the group of people who supported Johnny from the beginning have been right all along, but we will let you be the judge of that. Today, we will be discussing the LAPD Footage that exposed Amber Heard.

APOLOGY VIDEO
When Amber Heard smuggled their two pet dogs to Australia, which goes against the country’s laws- the pair came out with an apology video to address the situation. But, to a lot of people the video seemed weird. Although it was Heard herself who did the activity, Depp appeared to be quite off in the video and some even remarked that it looked like he was being forced to show up in front of the camera. We will let you be the judge of it.

PREMIERE OF ALICE THROUGH THE LOOKING GLASS
In 2016, when Johnny and Amber’s divorce were in the works, he attended a movie premiere at London. When asked if he had any message for his fans, Depp said some lines that sounded extremely weird and even funny to his fans and the audience. However, when we look back now- the message seems almost cryptic, as if he was trying to ask for help. Watch the interview for yourself.

Welcome toThe Gossipy. We make interesting videos about Hollywood in English. We give you a closer look in the lives of celebrities like Kanye West, Ed Sheeran, The Rock, Jay Z, Selena Gomez, Kylie Jenner, Kim Kardashian, Rihanna and 100s more.

Now Twitter is reacting to all the craziness between Elon Musk, Johnny Depp, and Amber Heard's fake payment to the ACLU. Let's break it down in today's video.

With the initial court date being pushed back, Johnny Depp and Amber Heard have been given some more time in order to gather more evidence for their individual cases. For quite some time, the two were firing evidence at each other in order to win in court. 

Ever since the recent release of the footage of the LAPD officers from the penthouse night of Amber Heard and Johnny Depp, things have not been looking all too bright for Amber Heard. Her team has been working tirelessly in order to back up her side, however Johnny Depp seems to have made the attempt to strike back.

It’s a Hollywood drama like the world has never seen. With an A-list cast, it’s full of intrigue and fiery dialogue, and topped off with lashings of sex and drugs. There is even a pivotal scene set right here in Australia, starring politician Barnaby Joyce. But this production isn’t playing at any theatre. Centre stage is a London court where actor Johnny Depp is suing an English tabloid for calling him a wife beater. As Tom Steinfort reveals, no one is going to win an Oscar, but Depp and his one-time bride, actress Amber Heard, have been putting on the performance of their lives, airing every sordid detail of their bizarre and doomed marriage.

Today two videos were played in court from the holiday weekend where people can be heard talking excitedly and laughing with Heard and Depp, who filmed the group enjoying themselves. When asked by Eleanor Laws, Mr Depp's QC,  to explain the footage, which showed no violence taking place, Heard replied: 'Our fights never happened in front of the family. They typically happened after everyone had gone to bed.' Ms Laws alleged that Heard was lying about the entire incident and said: 'You are making up this up as you go along'. Not all the faces of those in the darkened video are visible, but Heard can be seen picking up a drink and revealed that she could tell that Marilyn Manson was present after recognising his fingernails.  She also told the court that others present were her friend Rocky Pennington, Depp and his son Jack, Heard's father David and Erin Boerum, Heard's nurse and friend. Amber has claimed that her megastar ex-husband would blame his 'alter ego' called 'the monster' for the alleged violence while intoxicated with copious amounts of drink and drugs. In the film Depp can be heard joking with Jack Depp about a monster being in the room while Amber exclaims to a guest: 'What are you doing? Get away get away'.

This video was mainly to show the depositions and evidence side by side, to expose the truth while also keeping a proper timeline of what happened since 2016. KEEP IN MIND IT DOESN'T INCLUDE ALL THE EVIDENCE JOHNNY DEPP HAS. There's just too much for one video.

Please, I highly suggest you check out Brian's channel (IncrediblyAverage) and take some time to watch all of his videos, some being used in my video. You'll know everything. 👉🏼 https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCg0C-N_MPYYOXyF4T3jMxNQ

Hey everyone!  Welcome to my channel.  If you've been here before, welcome back and thanks for stopping by.

Note: I am aware that Johnny is now suing Amber for defamation.  That news broke as I was constructing this video.  However, I still feel this video contains some very important information, maybe now more than ever.

This is Part 1 of a video focusing mainly on the night of May 21st, 2016.  I should be finishing Part 2 in the next few days, so please be patient.  This has taken longer than I anticipated.

These videos (part 1 and 2) will play like one large video when watched back to back.  So until part 2 is uploaded, please try to not jump ahead with any reckless speculation.  Whereas part 1 exposes some lies and inconsistencies in stories told, part 2 really brings it all full circle and will expose (what I believe to be) some really big lies.  So again, patience.

This video may come off as a little more speculative.  For that, I apologize.  However, like always, it is all rooted and backed by plenty of research and facts.

We're told the video was shot months before the May 21 incident in which Amber claims Johnny struck her.
Amber asks Johnny if he drank a bottle of wine and tries to calm him down. She says she was sorry for something although she was not specific.   
Johnny isn't having it, and appears out of control. After throwing the glass and bottle, you see him swiping at Amber's phone ... trying to get it from her.

Hurls Wine Glass | TMZ,"Johnny Depp went crazy on Amber Heard in their kitchen, throwing a wine bottle and glass ... and she videotaped it. 
We're told the video was shot months before the May 21 incident in which Amber claims Johnny struck her.
Amber asks Johnny if he drank a bottle of wine and tries to calm him down. She says she was sorry for something although she was not specific.   
Johnny isn't having it, and appears out of control. After throwing the glass and bottle, you see him swiping at Amber's phone ... trying to get it from her.

Johnny Depp and his ex-wife Amber Heard have been involved in different legal battles for years now, and it finally looks like this drama might soon come to an end.
Johnny’s fans are now saying they can’t wait for justice to be finally served and for the court to prove what the fans claim they knew all along–that Amber heard was lying.
And it’s not just Johnny’s fans who always believed the actor was telling the truth, but also his celebrity friends and colleagues.
So as we wait for this bitter legal drama to reach its conclusion, let’s take a look at all the times celebs have warned us about Amber Heard’s lies.

Hey everyone. This video primarily focuses on the events and incident that occurred during March 2015 in Australia.  Amber claims she was abused while Johnny was on a 3-day drug and alcohol fueled bender.  Johnny denies this and claims Amber assaulted him and severed the end of his finger.

I hope this video begins to help clear things up with some new evidence and testimony...along with visuals.

Hey everyone!  Welcome back!  Or if you're here for the first time, I welcome you just the same!

This is a pretty straight forward video, not so much the analytical breakdowns I usually do.  Although there is a little bit of that in this one as well.

This video is exactly what the title states.  Amber Heard, during her 2016 deposition, admitted to multiple violent assaults against Johnny Depp.  Admissions she was probably hoping would never see the light of day.  I use official court sworn transcriptions of her own words, so there leaves no doubt.

This video will be referenced in my future videos, so if you plan to watch any of those, please give this one a watch as well.  Future videos will be breaking down individual moments of alleged abuse (some of which link directly to her admissions here) and will include evidence, witness testimony, and anything else that helps us get closer to the truth.

My previous videos and Twitter handle will be linked below.  When I'm active making videos, I'm not as active on Twitter and vice versa.

Thanks for checking this one out!  I really appreciate it.  Feel free to like and share.  Take care!

Hey everyone!  Welcome back!  Or if you're here for the first time, I welcome you just the same!

This is a pretty straight forward video, not so much the analytical breakdowns I usually do.  Although there is a little bit of that in this one as well.

This video is exactly what the title states.  Amber Heard, during her 2016 deposition, admitted to multiple violent assaults against Johnny Depp.  Admissions she was probably hoping would never see the light of day.  I use official court sworn transcriptions of her own words, so there leaves no doubt.

This video will be referenced in my future videos, so if you plan to watch any of those, please give this one a watch as well.  Future videos will be breaking down individual moments of alleged abuse (some of which link directly to her admissions here) and will include evidence, witness testimony, and anything else that helps us get closer to the truth.

My previous videos and Twitter handle will be linked below.  When I'm active making videos, I'm not as active on Twitter and vice versa.

Thanks for checking this one out!  I really appreciate it.  Feel free to like and share.  Take care!

Amber Heard Friends Testify AGAINST Her & Side With Johnny Depp

https://youtu.be/IfZzdVZrPuI

Celebs divorces are box-office gold for the media, so the legal fight between
movie stars Johnny Depp and Amber Heard lasts for 5 years already. So far, the
trial has featured testimony about: violent, shrieking rows. Massive
consumption of drugs and drink. Wild punches and trashed rooms, lopped off
fingertip, and many other things. But is it true that Johnny Depp is so close to
defeating Amber Heard in a defamation case?
Make sure you stay till the end to know Johnny Depp's odds of winning the
case.
The fact that Johnny Depp recently failed to secure an appeal in the “wife
beater” verdict against him in Britain is causing consequences on his other legal
battles in the US. Amber Heard's lawyers state that Johnny Depp's Stateside $50
million defamation lawsuit against Amber Heard should be dismissed.
Amber Heard's legal team (Heard and Charlson Bredehoft Cohen & Brown, PC
and Woods Rogers PC attorneys) declares a supplemental plea in bar, stating:
“Giving full effect to the UK Judgments necessitates a finding that statements in
the op-ed published in the Washington Post are true – Mr. Depp committed
domestic violence against Ms. Heard on many occasions, causing her to fear for
her life.” “Therefore, as a matter of law, Depp cannot prevail on any of his
claims, and Depp’s Complaint against Ms. Heard should be dismissed in its
entirety,” adds the April 13 filing that recently appeared on the Fairfax County
docket.
As the more than two-year-old matter crawls toward its new-ish April 11, 2022,
trial start date, Amber Heard has requested a May 28 hearing on her plea filing
in front of Judge Penney Azcarate, who was assigned to the case last month by
Chief Judge Bruce White.
Amber Heard's failed plan to destroy Johnny Depp in the past probably made
her try some new ideas. Now she is looking far ahead with a new strategy,
probably will help her gain a sure-footed move in the US court. The actress
seems to be absolutely desperate as she’s got nothing to lose. She has already

made so many mistakes and lied several times (and almost every time she was
caught lying). But what if her plan can actually work?
Because for now, it seems like her legal team is a little bit pushing. According to
all the testimony and evidence presented at that trial and Justice Nicol’s decree,
Amber Heard’s team believes once again that the March 2019-filed Virginia suit
should be DOA. “Depp cannot relitigate these factual issues, and as a result of
their preclusion, he cannot claim that the statements are false and ‘actionable’
under Virginia defamation law, so his claims are barred as a matter of law,” the
plea filing states.
...
The court date for the main defamation date is in April 2022 and we will make
sure to be the first ones to deliver the latest news to you. Thanks for watching

The case between Amber Heard and Johnny Depp is one that people are following all over the world. The anticipation builds day by day while fans of the actors wait for the official court hearing. Amber Heard is starting to create a pretty bad name for herself, but now might be the time for an offical apology to Johnny Depp. A lot of other celebrities have been dragged into this mess - one is the Tesla billionaire, Elon Musk (for some interesting reasons). And it does not seem like Elon Musk is quite done in this case, as Depp is not done dealing with him.

Top 10 Celebrities Who Tried To Warn Us About Amber Heard

https://youtu.be/OFO6sMJGjHc

Few celebrity breakups are as controversial as the ever-unfolding drama between Johnny
Depp and Amber Heard. Most people I know are either “Team Johnny” or “Team Amber,”
and they’ve spent a lot of time discussing who the real abuser in the troubled relationship
must have been. However, Johnny Depp was trying to warn everyone about Amber Heard
and who she is for real.
Over the past several months, we’ve heard from Depp’s friends, fans, and exes who all claim
he could have never mistreated Amber because of his sweet and gentle nature. And there
have been many doubts cast upon Heard, leading people to think she’s the core abuser, a
narcissistic gold digger, and ultimately, a liar. Adding to this we have Johnny Depp’s hints
and attempts to tell the truth about his ex wife.
Amber Heard is not an obvious abuser
We like to imagine that the real abuser is always some sort of obvious monster, and that
we’re not going to be manipulated by any wolves in sheep’s clothing. Do you remember that
‘message’ to Johnny Depp’s fans when he was ‘jokingly’ saying: “I’m scared to death, I’m
frightened and I don’t know what to do, I am confused and I want to go home”. This phrase
made everyone laugh but what if it was Johnny’s cry for help? He couldn’t tell anyone what
was going on between him and Amber Heard (before the legal fight) as he is a good person
and he didn’t want to show people their dirty laundry.
Amber Heard pretended to be a victim
The myth of the obvious abuser was very convenient for Amber Heard and of course
eventually it did more harm than good, even for Amber. People easily wind up defending
their guilty friends and blaming the victims. We might mistake self-defense and coping
mechanisms by victims as ""proof"" of their crimes. Victims of domestic violence may even
use violence themselves against their abusers, and it can be very difficult for outsiders to
establish which person is the primary abuser and which person is the primary victim. Johnny
Depp was trying to warn everyone she was a liar but he couldn’t prove he wasn’t guilty.
Amber Heard had a strong tactic - to lie in a court. But eventually body language experts
analysed the video back in 2016 court deposition. First everyone thought Amber Heard
behaved really weird because she was stressed and scared. But according to body
language experts, she just behaved like a typical liar.
Severed Finger
Being a real man Johnny Depp didn’t tell anyone what happened with his finger for real and
was even trying to hide the facts and lied to his friends about the incident! Obviously, he
wanted to protect Amber Heard. During the Venice Film Festival 2015 conference Dakota
Johnson obviously asked Johnny Depp about his finger, Johnny answered vaguely, he
avoided the question with the joke but it seems Dakota didn’t believe him. She knew:
something was wrong. Just notice, Dakota gave him a look that says that she knows more
than he lets on.

Amber Heard made him lie for her
You may remember the story about Amber Heard’s dogs and that she had some problems
with them. In July 2015 Amber Heard brought Yorkshire terriers Pistol and Boo to the
country illegally. And to avoid problems Amber Heard asked her former employee Kevin
Murphy to lie under oath after she was charged with bringing her two dogs to Australia
illegally. Murphy claimed Heard pressured him to commit perjury about the travelling terriers
or risk losing his job. “She wanted me to say essentially that it was my fault in one way or
another that the paperwork wasn’t completed, so that I could take the blame for her,” Murphy
said. And of course, she asked Johnny Depp to help with this problem. Isn’t it a warning sign
of ab**se? But probably Johnny Depp had to go along with everything Amber wanted
because he truly loved her. But she literally forced Johnny to help her with the problem and
he got in trouble as a result.

To say the Amber Heard Johnny Depp Court case has been ruthless, scandalous, and bitter would an understatement. Johnny Depp has been fired from big roles. Amber Heard has been fired from big roles too. But the court battle rolls. New evidence and documents are being brought up all the time now. Today we have update on new crucial evidence. We break it down in the video. Let's get into it.

With the initial court date being pushed back, Johnny Depp and Amber Heard have been given some more time in order to gather more evidence for their individual cases. For quite some time, the two were firing evidence at each other in order to win in court. 

Ever since the recent release of the footage of the LAPD officers from the penthouse night of Amber Heard and Johnny Depp, things have not been looking all too bright for Amber Heard. Her team has been working tirelessly in order to back up her side, however Johnny Depp seems to have made the attempt to strike back.

Can Amber Heard do anything out of the kindness of her own heart? I guess not. Amber Heard is clearly up to her schemes again. Even when it comes to her newborn daughter. A daughter who maybe might have Elon Musk or Johnny Depp as the father.

Johnny Depp and Amber Heard are back on the frontlines of celebrity news. Amber Heard just had a baby girl and rumors are swirling on who the baby's father is. Many are saying it is Johnny Depp. But no public statements have been made in this regard by either Johnny Depp or Amber Heard. So no one knows for sure yet. In this video, we breakdown the story in detail. This celebrity drama goes down while the Johnny Depp Amber Heard civil court case rages on.  

With the initial court date being pushed back, Johnny Depp and Amber Heard have been given some more time in order to gather more evidence for their individual cases. For quite some time, the two were firing evidence at each other in order to win in court. 

Ever since the recent release of the footage of the LAPD officers from the penthouse night of Amber Heard and Johnny Depp, things have not been looking all too bright for Amber Heard. Her team has been working tirelessly in order to back up her side, however Johnny Depp seems to have made the attempt to strike back.

Johnny Depp and Amber Heard have been involved in a handful of lawsuits dating back to their divorce in 2017. By that point, Heard had accused Depp of abuse, and that would lead to an April 2018 headline by The Sun, which referred to Depp as a Wife Beater. Recently, Judge Andrew Nicol determined that Amber’s claims were substantial, which also let The Sun off the hook. The 14 incidents that lead to the judge’s ultimate decision, which include the 12 leading to the court’s ultimate decision, as well as what he thought regarding each specific incident have now been released.

Join us in today’s video as we share with you the full apology of Amber Heard. Until now, none of either johnny Depp's or Amber Heard's accusations has ever been put before a judge or jury in any court anywhere, or even confirmed by police reports. But with everything that is going on between the two former co-stars and couple, it’s hard to lose track of how it all started in the first place.

Johnny Depp and Amber Heard went their separate ways after the divorce was finalized and it seemed like everything was calming down when Heard became romantically attached to billionaire inventor Elon Musk in the spring of 2017. That relationship, however, was short-lived. Because of all these chaos, Amber Heard has shared her thoughts. Be sure to watch the whole video and in addition, do us a favor and like the video and subscribe and turn on the notification bell. We’ll see you in the next video!

Elon Musk just keeps getting dragged back into the Johnny Depp Amber Heard celeb drama. Elon Musk, Johnny Depp and Amber Heard are back on the frontlines of celebrity news. Amber Heard just had a baby girl and rumors are swirling on who the baby's father is. 

Many are saying it is Johnny Depp. Some are saying is Elon Musk himself. Elon Musk and Amber Heard are past lovers and rumors are swirling that Elon Musk paid Amber Heard's 7 million donation to the ACLU back in 2016. So these two have a history together.

But no public statements have been made in this regard by either Elon Musk, Johnny Depp or Amber Heard. So no one knows for sure yet. In this video, we breakdown the story in detail. This celebrity drama goes down while the Johnny Depp Amber Heard civil court case rages on.

With the initial court date being pushed back, Johnny Depp and Amber Heard have been given some more time in order to gather more evidence for their individual cases. For quite some time, the two were firing evidence at each other in order to win in court. 

Ever since the recent release of the footage of the LAPD officers from the penthouse night of Amber Heard and Johnny Depp, things have not been looking all too bright for Amber Heard. Her team has been working tirelessly in order to back up her side, however Johnny Depp seems to have made the attempt to strike back.

Over the past couple of years the media has been flooding with news regarding the situation with Johnny Depp and Amber Heard. The issue between the two is that there were so many who were trying to figure out who was the victim in the relationship since there were different stories from each party in the relationship. As the case moves along further what many have noticed is that the finger is starting to solely point to Amber Heard as more and more evidence gets brought forward. People all over the world are starting to believe that Johnny Depp was wrongfully accused of several different acts, none of which he actually performed. Many are aware that this led him to not only lose several of his important acting roles, but also put him in a very tough place with the media.

A New York judge has partially granted a petition from the ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" star to determine if Heard donated the entirety of her $7 million divorce settlement to the American Civil Liberties Union and to Children's Hospital Los Angeles, as she pledged. As a result of the ruling, the ACLU must release documents that confirm whether or not Heard followed through on the donation promise, which has become a point of contention in the former couple's legal saga.“Mr. Depp is most gratified by the Court’s decision,"" Depp's attorney Benjamin Chew said in a statement to USA TODAY. USA TODAY has reached out to Heard's attorney and to the ACLU for comment. In November, Depp lost a libel lawsuit in London against the publisher of The Sun tabloid, which had labeled him a ""wife beater"" in a 2018 headline after Heard accused him of abuse in Los Angeles in 2016 as they were ending their short, volatile marriage. The case pitted Depp against a powerful tabloid and its editor, with Heard as their star witness. In March, Depp was refused an appeal after his lawyer Andrew Caldecott argued that Heard's donation pledge was a “calculated and manipulative lie"" that ""tipped the scales against Mr. Depp from the very beginning.""Caldecott also alleged one of Heard's intended charitable beneficiaries, Children's Hospital Los Angeles, wrote to Depp's business adviser in 2019 saying Heard had not made any payments. Lawyers for The Sun's publisher rejected the arguments in court in March, saying Heard did not lie about the donations because she was pledging to pay the sums over 10 years. She had made “a number of payments already in pursuance of these pledges,"" said Adam Wolanski, representing News Group Newspapers. Johnny Depp loses bid to appeal UK court ruling that he assaulted ex-wife Amber HeardThe High Court ruling came after a three-week circus-like trial in July, during which Depp and Heard both took the stand and both were damaged by lurid testimony about drinking, drug use, fighting and room-trashing. The judge ruled that ""the great majority"" of Heard's claims of abuse, as presented by the tabloid's publisher in its defense, were mostly true. Proceedings now move to Virginia, where a separate case arose after Heard published a column in the Washington Post in December 2018, proclaiming herself a victim of domestic abuse and suggesting, without actually using his name, that Depp was the alleged abuser. Three months later, Depp filed a lawsuit in Fairfax County (where the Post is printed) seeking $50 million and accusing his ex-wife of defaming him with ""hoax"" allegations of domestic abuse. Heard shot back by filing more than 300 pages of documents in Virginia, expanding on the abuse allegations she lodged against Depp during their divorce in 2016, claiming Depp regularly beat her up before she married him in 2015 and continued to do so during their 18-month marriage.

The tale of Amber Heard continues to get more and more curious as time goes on. Because she is in a war in court with her ex-husband Johnny Depp and it doesn't look to be getting any simpler as time goes on. Not the least of which is new evidence and more proof of her being a bad person coming to light. But she's holding fast and trying to keep going in the roles that she does have. Which right now includes Mera in the DCEU, which will continue via Aquaman 2. But a very familiar ""call to arms"" is happening that might just shut that down. We'll break it down for you.

Amber Heard Johnny Depp Lawsuit UPDATE,"As Johnny Depp and Amber Heard get deeper into their $50 million dollar lawsuit, lots and lots of fans, people, and even previous Amber Heard supporters are strolling away from her side and are choosing to side with Johnny Depp instead. You may remember that after losing his libel case against the news publisher “The Sun”, who gave him a very bad lable following Amber’s claims that he had hurt her, Johnny lost his chance to reprise his major role as Grindelwald in the upcoming third installment of the trilogy “Fantastic Beasts”, a prequel series to Harry Potter. Because of this, a huge volume of Johnny Depp fans around the globe were upset and angered, which led them to sign a petition for Warner Bros. to fire Amber from her role in the upcoming Aquaman sequel as well. However, despite reaching and even going over 1.6 million votes, the production company chose to let Amber stay in the movie. So how does Amber lose such a tremendous amount of supporters during the time that she needed them the most? What could Amber possibly have done to make her supporters lose interest in her? Well, let’s find out in this video. But before anything else, make sure to hit that subscribe button first and smash that notification bell for more updates. Let’s dive in!

Johnny and Amber’s romance started well, if one may say, before it all went down into ashes. There are those kinds of divorces that are amicable splits, while there are also divorce cases that are messy. Johnny and Amber’s divorce may be one of the messiest and chaotic in history. But how did it all come down to this? Let’s go back to the beginning. Johnny and Amber first ignited a spark between them when they starred together in the 2011 comedy-drama film, The Rum Diary. Johnny played a journalist who was immediately smitten with Amber’s character. However, this love story between the two quickly travelled from the screen to real life. Amber Heard even told Vogue quickly after the release of the film that, “Working with Johnny was torture. It was better than I ever imagined, which is really saying something.” Technically, hearing these words from the actress already hinted that the two really hit it off easily during their film taping, and even though the two of them did not quickly jump into a relationship right after the film shooting, the same year that the film was released, the relationships they both were in at the time fell apart, and that suggested quite a rare coincidence. Just a year after the film’s release, the two officially started dating. Their relationship seemed quite beautiful, and as a proof of this, in 2014, just a couple of months into dating, Amber was spotted wearing an engagement ring, where Johnny also made an announcement about their upcoming wedding. Another year after, the couple held a private wedding ceremony at their home in LA. Fans were really happy about how things were going between the two.

In 2016, Amber Heard filed for divorce. It shocked many people, especially their fans who thought they were living the best days of their married life, but turned out it wasn’t the case at all. Along with filing for divorce, Amber also accused Johnny of physically hurting her, providing some photos as evidence of Johnny’s acts. However, these incidents were proven to be fabricated by the police. She also applied for a restraining order against Johnny, which made many people at that time believe that she was telling the truth. Many fans supported her, and it was then as well that she used her newfound acclaim and victimhood to front as one of the most public faces of the #MeToo movement, and subsequently, to serve as ambassador and speaker for various entities, organizations, and companies, many of whom rewarded Amber financially for her time, image, and story. BUT, Johnny Depp’s team and a lot of fans as well, saw this as Amber’s way to manipulate people into thinking she is a victim rather than a perpetrator. In line with this, Amber also penned an article in the Washington Post.

Apart from this, fans and supporters of Amber also started to lose the courage to defend and support her as evidence of her extra marital affairs surfaced, showing her with actor James Franco and multi-billionaire Elon Musk. Elon had been issued a subpoena by Johnny Depp’s team.

As of now, despite all the chaos swirling around the their case, Amber’s team has tried to dismiss it twice already.

Why She's Losing ALL Her Supporters! Amber Heard Johnny Depp Lawsuit UPDATE,"As Johnny Depp and Amber Heard get deeper into their $50 million dollar lawsuit, lots and lots of fans, people, and even previous Amber Heard supporters are strolling away from her side and are choosing to side with Johnny Depp instead. You may remember that after losing his libel case against the news publisher “The Sun”, who gave him a very bad lable following Amber’s claims that he had hurt her, Johnny lost his chance to reprise his major role as Grindelwald in the upcoming third installment of the trilogy “Fantastic Beasts”, a prequel series to Harry Potter. Because of this, a huge volume of Johnny Depp fans around the globe were upset and angered, which led them to sign a petition for Warner Bros. to fire Amber from her role in the upcoming Aquaman sequel as well. However, despite reaching and even going over 1.6 million votes, the production company chose to let Amber stay in the movie. So how does Amber lose such a tremendous amount of supporters during the time that she needed them the most? What could Amber possibly have done to make her supporters lose interest in her? Well, let’s find out in this video. But before anything else, make sure to hit that subscribe button first and smash that notification bell for more updates. Let’s dive in!

Johnny and Amber’s romance started well, if one may say, before it all went down into ashes. There are those kinds of divorces that are amicable splits, while there are also divorce cases that are messy. Johnny and Amber’s divorce may be one of the messiest and chaotic in history. But how did it all come down to this? Let’s go back to the beginning. Johnny and Amber first ignited a spark between them when they starred together in the 2011 comedy-drama film, The Rum Diary. Johnny played a journalist who was immediately smitten with Amber’s character. However, this love story between the two quickly travelled from the screen to real life. Amber Heard even told Vogue quickly after the release of the film that, “Working with Johnny was torture. It was better than I ever imagined, which is really saying something.” Technically, hearing these words from the actress already hinted that the two really hit it off easily during their film taping, and even though the two of them did not quickly jump into a relationship right after the film shooting, the same year that the film was released, the relationships they both were in at the time fell apart, and that suggested quite a rare coincidence. Just a year after the film’s release, the two officially started dating. Their relationship seemed quite beautiful, and as a proof of this, in 2014, just a couple of months into dating, Amber was spotted wearing an engagement ring, where Johnny also made an announcement about their upcoming wedding. Another year after, the couple held a private wedding ceremony at their home in LA. Fans were really happy about how things were going between the two.

In 2016, Amber Heard filed for divorce. It shocked many people, especially their fans who thought they were living the best days of their married life, but turned out it wasn’t the case at all. Along with filing for divorce, Amber also accused Johnny of physically hurting her, providing some photos as evidence of Johnny’s acts. However, these incidents were proven to be fabricated by the police. She also applied for a restraining order against Johnny, which made many people at that time believe that she was telling the truth. Many fans supported her, and it was then as well that she used her newfound acclaim and victimhood to front as one of the most public faces of the #MeToo movement, and subsequently, to serve as ambassador and speaker for various entities, organizations, and companies, many of whom rewarded Amber financially for her time, image, and story.

Thompson, ""The Rum Diary"" tells the increasingly unhinged story of itinerant journalist Paul Kemp (Johnny Depp). Tiring of the noise and madness of New York and the crushing conventions of late Eisenhower-era America, Kemp travels to the pristine island of Puerto Rico to write for a local newspaper, The San Juan Star, run by downtrodden editor Lotterman (Richard Jenkins). Adopting the rum-soaked life of the island, Paul soon becomes obsessed with Chenault (Amber Heard), the wildly attractive Connecticut-born fiancée of Sanderson (Aaron Eckhart). Sanderson, a businessman involved in shady property development deals, is one of a growing number of American entrepreneurs who are determined to convert Puerto Rico into a capitalist paradise in service of the wealthy. When Kemp is recruited by Sanderson to write favorably about his latest unsavory scheme, the journalist is presented with a choice: to use his words for the corrupt businessmen's financial benefit, or use them to take the bastards down.

Filming began in Puerto Rico in March 2009. It is currently set to be released on October 28, 2011.

Production
Hunter S. Thompson wrote the novel The Rum Diary in 1961, but the novel was not published until 1998. The independent production companies Shooting Gallery and SPi Films sought to adapt the novel into a film in 2000, and actor Johnny Depp was signed to star and to serve as executive producer. Nick Nolte was also signed to star alongside Depp. The project did not move past the development stage. During this stage, Hunter S. Thompson became so frustrated as to fire off an obscenity-laden letter calling the process a ""waterhead fuckaround"".

In 2002, a new producer sought the project, and Benicio del Toro and Josh Hartnett were signed to star in the film adaptation. The second incarnation also did not move past the development stage. In 2007, producer Graham King acquired all rights to the novel and sought to film the adaptation under Warner Independent Pictures. Depp, who previously starred in the 1998 film adaptation of Thompson's novel Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, was cast as the freelance journalist Paul Kemp. Amber Heard is reported to have won the role out over Scarlett Johansson and Keira Knightley. Bruce Robinson joined to write the screenplay and to direct The Rum Diary. In 2009, Depp's production company Infinitum Nihil took on the project with the financial backing of King and his production company GK Films. Principal photography began in Puerto Rico on March 25, 2009. Composer Christopher Young has signed on to compose the film's soundtrack.

The alcoholic Robinson had been sober for six-and-a-half years before he started writing the screenplay for The Rum Diary. The filmmaker found himself suffering from writer's block. He started drinking again, a bottle of alcohol a day until he finished the script and then he quit drinking again. He spent a year filming in Puerto Rico, Mexico and Hollywood and resisted drinking until they arrived in Fajardo. Robinson remembers, ""It was 100 degrees at two in the morning and very humid. Everyone's drenched in sweat. One of the prop guys goes by with a barrow-load of ice and Coronas. I said: 'Johnny, this doesn't mean anything.' And reached for a Corona."" ... Some savage drinking took place. When I was no longer in Johnny's environment I went back to sobriety.""",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/R8KblG1S0_A/default.jpg,120,90,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/R8KblG1S0_A/mqdefault.jpg,320,180,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/R8KblG1S0_A/hqdefault.jpg,480,360,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/R8KblG1S0_A/sddefault.jpg,640.0,480.0,Movieclips Trailers,"['Johnny Depp', 'Hunter S.

Como esse caso já tá rolando há muito tempo na justiça, comecemos do início. Amber Heard e Johnny Depp se casaram em 3 de fevereiro de 2015 em uma cerimônia muito reservada que aconteceu justamente na casa deles em Los Angeles, depois de 4 anos em que já haviam se conhecido no set do filme “Diário de um Jornalista Bêbado”. Depois de 15 meses de casamento, Amber pediu o divórcio sob a justificativa de diferenças irreconciliáveis. Quatro dias depois, ela entrou com uma ordem de restrição contra o ator por violência doméstica, que ia de puxada de cabelo até o infame incidente em que Johnny Depp supostamente teria jogado um telefone celular contra ela! Além dessa ordem ela também queria que ele tomasse distância do “catioro” do ex-casal. Mais que isso, surgiram fotos de Amber com hematomas no rosto e ela alegou que Johnny a havia abusado verbal e fisicamente.

Top 10 Celebrities Who Defended Johnny Depp

https://youtu.be/uJ9KUTXlulw

The never ending fight between Johnny Depp and Amber Heard seems to last forever. Every
day the press reveals new facts and new details about the situation but no one knows how it
all going to end and who is the victim and who is the liar. But the only thing which left for us -
is to analyze the facts. After ex-wife Amber Heard accused him of committing domestic
violence during their marriage, multiple celebrities with ties to Johnny Depp have come
forward in his defense. This is really impressive but Depp’s other ex-wife and mother of his
two children, Vanessa Paradis, Depp’s ex-fiance Winona Ryder, and his former co-star
Penelope Cruz have all testified in the actor’s defense. It should be noted that though all
three women insist Depp was never violent in their presence, the only ones for certain who
know the intimate details of Heard and Depp’s marriage are Depp and Heard. Anyways, let’s
listen to what many celebrities had to say about the entire situation and why they defend
Johnny Depp.
10. Winona Ryder
Winona Ryder is The Blast, Depp’s Edward Scissorhands‘ co-star and his ex-girlfriend. She
declared that she had never experienced any of the behavior that Heard detailed. She said:
“From my experience, which was so wildly different, I was absolutely shocked, confused and
upset when I heard the accusations against him.” Ryder continued as part of her statement
in defense of Depp’s character, “The idea that he is an incredibly violent person is the
farthest thing from Johnny I knew and loved. I cannot wrap my head around these
accusations.” Winona Ryder went on to say that Johnny Depp was “never, never” violent or
abusive towards her or “towards anybody I have seen.” She also said that she’d always “felt
so very, very safe with him.”
9. Sharon Osbourne
Speaking on US daytime hit The Talk, Sharon compared the pair's relationship to her violent
marriage to Ozzy saying: ""She gave him as good as she got."" The former X Factor judge
said: ""Do you know what I think? It takes two to Tango. I think they had a very vulnerable
relationship. I think they're both as bad as each other."" Sharon continued: ""She gave him as
good as she got. It wasn't just like a little mouse in the corner being battered. She gave him
back. Speaking about Depp and Heard on The Talk this week, Sharon insisted: ""If there is
enough love you work through it with help. But there obviously wasn't that love to keep them
together. ""He was defending himself, she was defending herself. Whatever went on only
those two know. They both hurt each other”.
8. Laura Wasser
Depp’s high-powered divorce attorney Laura Wasser, who has also represented clients like
Agelina Jolie and allegedly works with Kim Kardashian, responded to Heard’s restraining
order request in court documents, saying the actress is “attempting to secure a premature
financial resolution by alleging abuse.” “Her current application for a temporary restraining
order along with her financial requests appears to be in response to the negative media
attention she received earlier this week after filing for divorce,” Wasser wrote. “Yet Johnny
cannot protect himself or Amber from media scrutiny, and Amber’s anger certainly cannot

drive this dissolution proceeding.” Wasser also alleges that Heard took advantage of Depp at
an emotional time – his mother having died three days before Heard filed for divorce on
Monday.
7. Laurie Holden
Walking Dead star Laurie Holden defended Depp on Twitter, in an “impassioned reaction to
the vilification of a human being on social media and the public outcry for complete and utter
rumination.”
“I, for one, am going to see Johnny Depp’s new movie,” the 46-year-old actress tweeted
about Alice Through the Looking Glass. “His personal life is just that. Personal. No one
knows the real truth so just zip it.” “To be clear: I am just saying DON’T JUMP TO
CONCLUSIONS,” she added. “Even a pic might not be telling the whole story....”

Robert Downey Jr. Steps Up For Johnny Depp Since Disney Won't

https://youtu.be/YG2dPHN3NsE

The fact that Johnny Depp was fired from his role in the Pirates of the Caribbean is not
something new. But still, the fans were absolutelly upset and mad as they can't imagine their
favorite movie without Johnny. Moreover, many people believe that it was just unfair to fire
him as Johnny Depp has had a long working relationship with Disney. The main reason
which made kids’ favorite channel cut ties with Johnny was his recent court cases in both the
U.K. and the U.S.. The problems between Johnny Depp and Amber Heard made a lot of
mess and as a result, Amber’s allegations of domestic violence and ongoing legal troubles
reportedly cost Johnny Depp his Oscar-nominated, starring role in the multibillion-dollar
grossing Pirates of the Caribbean franchise.
It’s been already said a lot about how difficult Johnny Depp and Amber Heard’s break up is
as the nightmare for these two began in 2016. Since that year they've been legally fighting
against each other, accusing each other in inappropriate behavior, violence,
libel and many other things. Moreover, 2020 wasn't really easy for Johnny Depp. It was full
of libel trials against News Group Newspapers, the publisher of The Sun, in court over a
2018 article in which they called him a ""wife beater"". During the trial Depp denied he's being
violent to Amber and also accused Heard of having extra-marital affairs with James Franco
and Elon Musk, which Heard also denies. However, no matter how Depp tried, the court
ruled against Depp in the libel trial.
Due to recently highlighted personal issues and allegations made against the famed actor,
Depp has been dumped by many major film studios. It all began with the fact Depp
announced that he had been 'asked to resign' from his role as Grindewald in 'Fantastic
Beasts 3'. He posted on his Instagram: ""I wish to let you know that I have been asked to
resign by Warner Bros. from my role as Grindelwald in 'Fantastic Beasts' and I have
respected and agreed to that request."" He continued, ""... I intend to prove that the
allegations against me are false,"" Depp added. ""My life and career will not be defined by this
moment in time.""
And then Walt Disney Pictures who said ‘goodbye’ to Johnny Depp. According to a
Washington Post report, Disney is said to have dropped Depp from the Pirates franchise just
four days after Heard’s incendiary 2018 op-ed in the same publication, in which she claimed,
without naming Depp, that she was the victim of domestic violence. Depp’s lawyers claimed
that the actor’s removal from the multibillion-dollar grossing franchise was because of her
allegations.
In 2018, Disney production chief Sean Bailey confirmed that Depp was no longer a part of
the franchise’s future plans. He told The Hollywood Reporter, “We want to bring in a new
energy and vitality. I love the Pirates movies, but part of the reason writers Paul Wernick and
Rhett Reese are so interesting is that we want to give it a kick in the pants. And that’s what
I’ve tasked them with.”
Moreover, some people think it was not the only reason for Disney to ‘break up’ Johnny

Robert Downey Jr. Steps Up For Johnny Depp Since Disney Won't

The fact that Johnny Depp was fired from his role in the Pirates of the Caribbean is not
something new. But still, the fans were absolutelly upset and mad as they can't imagine their
favorite movie without Johnny. Moreover, many people believe that it was just unfair to fire
him as Johnny Depp has had a long working relationship with Disney. The main reason
which made kids’ favorite channel cut ties with Johnny was his recent court cases in both the
U.K. and the U.S.. The problems between Johnny Depp and Amber Heard made a lot of
mess and as a result, Amber’s allegations of domestic violence and ongoing legal troubles
reportedly cost Johnny Depp his Oscar-nominated, starring role in the multibillion-dollar
grossing Pirates of the Caribbean franchise.
It’s been already said a lot about how difficult Johnny Depp and Amber Heard’s break up is
as the nightmare for these two began in 2016. Since that year they've been legally fighting
against each other, accusing each other in inappropriate behavior, violence,
libel and many other things. Moreover, 2020 wasn't really easy for Johnny Depp. It was full
of libel trials against News Group Newspapers, the publisher of The Sun, in court over a
2018 article in which they called him a ""wife beater"". During the trial Depp denied he's being
violent to Amber and also accused Heard of having extra-marital affairs with James Franco
and Elon Musk, which Heard also denies. However, no matter how Depp tried, the court
ruled against Depp in the libel trial.
Due to recently highlighted personal issues and allegations made against the famed actor,
Depp has been dumped by many major film studios. It all began with the fact Depp
announced that he had been 'asked to resign' from his role as Grindewald in 'Fantastic
Beasts 3'. He posted on his Instagram: ""I wish to let you know that I have been asked to
resign by Warner Bros. from my role as Grindelwald in 'Fantastic Beasts' and I have
respected and agreed to that request."" He continued, ""... I intend to prove that the
allegations against me are false,"" Depp added. ""My life and career will not be defined by this
moment in time.""
And then Walt Disney Pictures who said ‘goodbye’ to Johnny Depp. According to a
Washington Post report, Disney is said to have dropped Depp from the Pirates franchise just
four days after Heard’s incendiary 2018 op-ed in the same publication, in which she claimed,
without naming Depp, that she was the victim of domestic violence. Depp’s lawyers claimed
that the actor’s removal from the multibillion-dollar grossing franchise was because of her
allegations.
In 2018, Disney production chief Sean Bailey confirmed that Depp was no longer a part of
the franchise’s future plans. He told The Hollywood Reporter, “We want to bring in a new
energy and vitality. I love the Pirates movies, but part of the reason writers Paul Wernick and
Rhett Reese are so interesting is that we want to give it a kick in the pants. And that’s what
I’ve tasked them with.”
Moreover, some people think it was not the only reason for Disney to ‘break up’ Johnny
Depp. Another reason for his removal could be the fact that Disney couldn’t afford him
anymore. According to Forbes, Depp’s salary, including a healthy profit percentage, reaches
close to $100 million per Pirates film. Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales, the

series’ fifth film, registered a box office haul of almost $800 million, well below the over $1
billion totals of the franchise’s second and fourth films, and the $963 million haul of the third
one. Disney is looking to save $90 million by recasting Depp, the report said.

But how did all of this frenzy start? How did the romantic private wedding go down this badly? And what were the actions taken by Amber Heard that were angering the judges so much? Let’s all find out in this video. But before we go any further, make sure to hit that subscribe button and notification bell first for more updates. So, let’s begin!

If you remember, Johnny Depp has been at the height of his career in the industry for many, many years now. He started acting as early as the 1980’s, when he first appeared in the horror-slash-thriller film “A Nightmare on Elm Street '', and played a minor role as the boyfriend of the main character. This helped Johnny begin his acting career, landing more minor roles and then major ones. Later on, he became a popular star of the classic, eccentric director Tim Burton’s films, where he portrayed various roles that all have these similarities: unique, bizarre, and kinda creepy in their own ways. In the romantic fantasy film “Edward Scissorhands”, he met his ex-partner Winona Ryder, whom we all see now in the sci-fi series Stranger Things. The two of them dated for four years, and even though the couple ended things between them in the 90’s, Winona still defended Johnny against Amber Heard on her recent allegations of abuse. He also played a few roles with Helena Bonham Carter in many Tim Burton films such as Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Alice in Wonderland and Alice Through the Looking Glass, Corpse Bride, Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street, and Dark Shadows. One of the most widely-known appearances of Johnny Depp that perhaps brought him the largest commercial and critical success was the Disney media franchise “Pirates of the Carribean” series, where he landed and reprised his lead role for all five movies that ran from 2003 to 2017. 

Amber Heard, on the other hand, started her acting career in 2003, first by appearing in two music videos, and then later on landing small supporting roles in three various television series. This then later on elevated her to more film and television roles, both in the supporting and lead actress roles. Her latest film that hit commercial success was the 2018 DC movie “Aquaman”, where she co-starred alongside Jason Momoa as Mera, the Atlantean Queen. However, even amidst the controversies circling her divorce with Johnny Depp, she managed to keep and reprise her role in the 2021 superhero film “Zack Snyder’s Justice League'', a director’s cut of the 2017 film. Not only that, but she also starred in the post-apocalyptic miniseries “The Stand”, which was based on Stephen King’s novel of the same name. Here, she co-starred alongside Alexander Skarsgård, James Marden, and Odessa Young, and it premiered in December 2020. This upset fans because as Johnny was being banned from reprising his role as Grindelwald, Amber got to star in more films and series, and not only that, she was also reported to reappear as Mera in the sequel of the DC movie Aquaman which is set to start filming in July of 2021. Many fans saw this as an unfair treatment, given that both actors slash ex-lovers are facing the ongoing lawsuits between them.

And just recently, there has been a new occurrence in the ongoing defamation case against Amber’s article on The Washington Post, and it seems like Johnny’s side is stepping a little ahead of the game.

Amber Heard has been looking into Disney and what the company knew about Johnny’s actions and behavior during his time on the Pirates of the Caribbean films. For his part, Johnny has asserted Amber has lied on several occasions, including saying she would give their divorce settlement to charity but didn’t, and also said she had asserted he was violent once, when police body cam footage allegedly showed otherwise. Not so cool, Amber. Her lawyer has also said that the Aquaman 2 actress has not been able to pay out the full divorce settlement to charity.

But how did all of this frenzy start? How did the romantic private wedding go down this badly? And what were the actions taken by Amber Heard that were angering the judges so much?

If you remember, Johnny Depp has been at the height of his career in the industry for many, many years now. He started acting as early as the 1980’s, when he first appeared in the horror-slash-thriller film “A Nightmare on Elm Street '', and played a minor role as the boyfriend of the main character. This helped Johnny begin his acting career, landing more minor roles and then major ones. Later on, he became a popular star of the classic, eccentric director Tim Burton’s films, where he portrayed various roles that all have these similarities: unique, bizarre, and kinda creepy in their own ways. In the romantic fantasy film “Edward Scissorhands”, he met his ex-partner Winona Ryder, whom we all see now in the sci-fi series Stranger Things. The two of them dated for four years, and even though the couple ended things between them in the 90’s, Winona still defended Johnny against Amber Heard on her recent allegations of abuse. He also played a few roles with Helena Bonham Carter in many Tim Burton films such as Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Alice in Wonderland and Alice Through the Looking Glass, Corpse Bride, Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street, and Dark Shadows. One of the most widely-known appearances of Johnny Depp that perhaps brought him the largest commercial and critical success was the Disney media franchise “Pirates of the Carribean” series, where he landed and reprised his lead role for all five movies that ran from 2003 to 2017.

Amber Heard first accused Johnny Depp of being violent towards her back in 2016 when she filed a court petition claiming. 
Amber’s accusations came at the height of the #MeToo movement, and the actress was hailed as a “hero” for speaking up about the alleged violence she endured during her relationship with Johnny.
But it’s 2021, and the narrative has completely changed. The fans are now convinced Amber was the violent one in the relationships and that she tried to frame Johnny by co-opting the #MeToo movement.
So why do fans think Johnny is the real #MeToo victim?

However, their feud that rooted from their messy marriage did not end there, and now, the case is swirling once again as their latest court trial is about to come in July this year. As the trials are coming near, the issue that has somehow been buried deep in the internet has recently surfaced once again, and guess who’s been the subject of ridicule these past few weeks? You guessed that right, Amber Heard. Amber seemed to have been losing more and more of her supporters due to more and more evidence surfacing in the media, including the fact that she couldn’t provide proof that she donated the money she got from her divorce settlement, which she promised to donate to charity. But where is it now?  Then there was evidence of her having affairs with actor, James Franco and multi-billionaire, Elon Musk. But what angered most people was the fact that Johnny Depp was forced to step down from his role as Grindelwald in the upcoming third franchise of the film trilogy “Fantastic Beasts”. Now, the trilogy is quite a big deal in the entertainment industry, considering that it is the prequel series to one of the most prominent film series of all time, “Harry Potter”. And aside from this, Johnny is actually an incredibly big name in the industry as well, and not just because of his very famous role as Jack Sparrow, but also because he has starred in countless movies too. But now that Johnny had been removed from his role, people’s fury shot directly at Amber Heard, as she was going back to reprise her role in the second installment of the DC Extended Universe film Aquaman, despite the lawsuits she is currently facing. Many, many fans were enraged by this, and some even started a petition to request Warner Bros. to fire Amber Heard, the same way they did to Johnny. But after a very long deliberation, did these people who fought for Johnny Depp’s equal treatment in the industry actually succeed? Had Warner Bros. finally come to their senses and fired Amber Heard from their newest DC film? Well, let’s find out in this video. But before everything else, make sure to hit that subscribe button first and smash that notification bell for more updates. So, let’s begin!

Let’s backtrack a little bit into Johnny and Amber’s career. Johnny Depp has been at the height of his career in the industry for many, many years now, and despite everything he is going through, he is nowhere close to a stop. He started acting as early as the 1980’s, when he first appeared in the horror-slash-thriller film “A Nightmare on Elm Street '', and played a minor role as the boyfriend of the main character. This helped Johnny begin his acting career, landing more minor roles and then major ones, including in the 2010 romantic thriller film “The Tourist” in which he co-starred with respected actress Angelina Jolie.

After many more roles, Johnny landed one of his biggest commercial films, the critically acclaimed Disney media franchise, the “Pirates of the Carribean” series, which is one of the major projects that really skyrocketed Johnny’s career into its highest point. In this series, he worked with numerous legendary actors and actresses, and worked on the lead role of Jack Sparrow, which earned him a remarkably huge fan following, as he reprised his role in all five movies that ran from 2003 to 2017. Some people even call him Jack Sparrow more often than his real name. Needless to say, he was and still is, a legend in the film industry. But we can’t say that now in his 2011 comedy drama film “The Rum Diary” which we can now safely say was not the brightest decision he made, as this was the film where he met his ex-wife, Amber Heard.

On the other hand, Amber Heard started her acting career in 2003, first by appearing in two music videos, and then later in landing small supporting roles in three various television series. This then later on elevated her to more film and television roles as both a supporting and lead actress. Her latest film that hit commercial success was the 2018 DCEU movie “Aquaman”, where she co-starred alongside Jason Momoa as Mera, the Atlantean Queen. 

Above all these, Amber Heard manages to keep her name in the headlines as many more issues come up. She even angered a judge in Virginia once, warning her not to waste the court’s time.

Amber Heard – a lot of people had no idea who she was until her divorce from Johnny Depp.
Her biggest role by far is that of Mera, in Aquaman – the love interest of none other than
Aquaman himself.
The mess between Amber Heard and Johnny Depp is still ongoing, but when it first started
making headlines Amber had released a phone video making Johnny appear to be a
drunken ab**er.
As time went on and court trials ensued, eventually the public learned that Amber was the
toxic component of the former celebrity couple. People started thinking deeply and realized
the irony of Amber Heard’s career. She wasn’t exactly the most well- known actress, until
she met the man who was already extremely popular in Hollywood. It made so many fans
think that Amber Heard benefited from marrying Johnny. Amber started to gain more
attention in the public eye via her appearances in movies like ‘Justice League’ and
‘Aquaman’ and she actually started getting more and more great roles than ever before.
Amber and Johnny dated for years before finally getting married in 2015, but that’s when
things started to reveal their true nature. It also made people suspicious as their marriage
lasted only one year.
Jealousy, anger, ab**se, lies - the things which filled this marriage from the start and
obviously, that’s not a good combination for those who want to be a happy couple. But things
started to get intense in the worst way, when in 2016 Amber filed for divorce from Johnny
and also obtained a temporary restraining order against him. She alleged that Johnny had
physically ab**ed her during their relationship, and said it was usually while under the
influence of dr**gs or alc***ol.
She alleged that at the time of filing for divorce, an incident had recently taken place in which
Johnny Depp threw his phone at her, leaving her with a bruised face.
Johnny Depp denied these accusations and through his representatives said Amber Heard
was ""attempting to secure a premature financial resolution by alleging ab*se."" But by that
time no one believed Johnny Depp and his career started falling apart.
In December 2018, Amber Heard wrote an op-ed for The Washington Post saying she was
ab*sed. In this op-ed for The Washington Post she spoke about the treatment of women in
domestic ab*se cases.
She wrote: ""I became a public figure representing domestic ab*se, and I felt the full force of
our culture's wrath for women who speak out."" After that the newspapers labeled him as an
‘ab*ser’ and ‘wife beater’ And In 2019, Johnny Depp sued Amber Heard for $50 million for
defamation over the WaPo article.
The suit said that Amber Heard ""is not a victim of domestic ab*se, she is a perpetrator,"" and
denied that Johnny Depp ever ab*sed her. Instead, the suit said that Amber Heard's
allegations were part of an ""elaborate hoax to generate positive publicity"" for the actress.

Johnny Depp's lawyers said: ""The op-ed depended on the central premise that Ms. Heard
was a domestic abuse victim and that Mr. Depp perpetrated domestic violence against her.""
And that’s when things really got intense and Amber’s true nature started to reveal itself.
Finally, Amber Heard’s claims of ab*se started to be revealed as false one by one. First of
all, the police spokesman revealed that an investigation into the domestic incident ‘radio call’
which Amber Heard stated previously, found that no crime had taken place.
Plus,Johnny Depp had his own proof that Amber was lying. Mainly, Johnny had a recording of a time when Amber ab*sed him.
In January, phone recordings obtained by the Daily Mail were released. In these recordings,
Amber Heard admitted to ""hitting"" Johnny Depp.
Amber is heard saying: ""I'm sorry that I didn't ... hit you across the face in a proper slap, but I
was hitting you, it was not punching you. Babe, you're not punched.
""I don't know what the motion of my actual hand was, but you're fine, I did not hurt you, I did
not punch you, I was hitting you.""
...
Now I want to hear your opinion about Amber Heard. Do you think she is the one who played
the victim card to get sympathy and tried to frame an innocent man? Let me know what you
think in the comments section down below.

Amber Heard – a lot of people had no idea who she was until her divorce from Johnny Depp.
Her biggest role by far is that of Mera, in Aquaman – the love interest of none other than
Aquaman himself.
The mess between Amber Heard and Johnny Depp is still ongoing, but when it first started
making headlines Amber had released a phone video making Johnny appear to be a
drunken ab**er.
As time went on and court trials ensued, eventually the public learned that Amber was the
toxic component of the former celebrity couple. People started thinking deeply and realized
the irony of Amber Heard’s career. She wasn’t exactly the most well- known actress, until
she met the man who was already extremely popular in Hollywood. It made so many fans
think that Amber Heard benefited from marrying Johnny. Amber started to gain more
attention in the public eye via her appearances in movies like ‘Justice League’ and
‘Aquaman’ and she actually started getting more and more great roles than ever before.
Amber and Johnny dated for years before finally getting married in 2015, but that’s when
things started to reveal their true nature. It also made people suspicious as their marriage
lasted only one year.
Jealousy, anger, ab**se, lies - the things which filled this marriage from the start and
obviously, that’s not a good combination for those who want to be a happy couple. But things
started to get intense in the worst way, when in 2016 Amber filed for divorce from Johnny
and also obtained a temporary restraining order against him. She alleged that Johnny had
physically ab**ed her during their relationship, and said it was usually while under the
influence of dr**gs or alc***ol.
She alleged that at the time of filing for divorce, an incident had recently taken place in which
Johnny Depp threw his phone at her, leaving her with a bruised face.
Johnny Depp denied these accusations and through his representatives said Amber Heard
was ""attempting to secure a premature financial resolution by alleging ab*se."" But by that
time no one believed Johnny Depp and his career started falling apart.
In December 2018, Amber Heard wrote an op-ed for The Washington Post saying she was
ab*sed. In this op-ed for The Washington Post she spoke about the treatment of women in
domestic ab*se cases.
She wrote: ""I became a public figure representing domestic ab*se, and I felt the full force of
our culture's wrath for women who speak out."" After that the newspapers labeled him as an
‘ab*ser’ and ‘wife beater’ And In 2019, Johnny Depp sued Amber Heard for $50 million for
defamation over the WaPo article.
The suit said that Amber Heard ""is not a victim of domestic ab*se, she is a perpetrator,"" and
denied that Johnny Depp ever ab*sed her. Instead, the suit said that Amber Heard's
allegations were part of an ""elaborate hoax to generate positive publicity"" for the actress.

Johnny Depp's lawyers said: ""The op-ed depended on the central premise that Ms. Heard
was a domestic abuse victim and that Mr. Depp perpetrated domestic violence against her.""
And that’s when things really got intense and Amber’s true nature started to reveal itself.
Finally, Amber Heard’s claims of ab*se started to be revealed as false one by one. First of
all, the police spokesman revealed that an investigation into the domestic incident ‘radio call’
which Amber Heard stated previously, found that no crime had taken place.
Plus,Johnny Depp had his own proof that Amber was lying. Mainly, Johnny had a recording of a time when Amber ab*sed him.
In January, phone recordings obtained by the Daily Mail were released. In these recordings,
Amber Heard admitted to ""hitting"" Johnny Depp.
Amber is heard saying: ""I'm sorry that I didn't ... hit you across the face in a proper slap, but I
was hitting you, it was not punching you. Babe, you're not punched.
""I don't know what the motion of my actual hand was, but you're fine, I did not hurt you, I did
not punch you, I was hitting you.""
...
Now I want to hear your opinion about Amber Heard. Do you think she is the one who played
the victim card to get sympathy and tried to frame an innocent man? Let me know what you
think in the comments section down below.

Johnny and Amber’s story started in flames when the two met on the set of the movie “The Rum Diary”, in which Johnny played a journalist who was immediately smitten with Amber’s character. However, this spark portrayed in the film continued off-screen, where Amber Heard told Vogue “working with Johnny was something else. It was better than I ever imagined, which is really saying something.” After the end of the said film, the two started dating. Depp was then sharing his life with partner Vanessa Paradis whom he lived with for 14 years and whom he had two kids with, while Heard was with her then girlfriend Tasya van Ree. When Johnny and Amber started dating in 2012, they both ended their previous relationships. The start of their romance seemed quite good, but where and how did it end up so messy? And who were the people who bravely took a stand to help Johnny Depp? Let’s find out, but first, make sure that you hit that subscribe button, smash that like button and hit the notification bell for more updates. Now, let’s have a short recap of Amber and Johnny’s roller-coaster ride on lover’s lane.

In 2014, Amber was spotted wearing an engagement ring, stirring rumors. This rumored engagement did not stay secret long enough, as Johnny himself confirmed this in an interview. In 2015, after several years of dating, Johnny married Amber in a very private ceremony in their home in Los Angeles. However, their married life did not seem to go as well as expected, as Amber filed for divorce just after a year after their marriage, and accused Johnny Depp of physical abuse. Well, that’s what you call “disappearing as fast as it came”. Together with the divorce filed, Amber also filed a temporary restraining order against Johnny, saying that the actor usually hurt her while under the influence. She also alleged that while filing for divorce, Johnny threw a phone at her, bruising her face, an accusation that Johnny denied, and investigators found false. 

The divorce was finalized in 2017, a year after Amber filed for it. However, the former couple’s lawsuits were far from over. In 2018, Amber wrote an op-ed to The Washington Post saying that she was mistreated, and in which she spoke about the treatment of women in these types of court cases. 
He was asked to resign from his role as Grindelwald in the Fantastic Beasts 3.  Due to this, other actors perceived this as “unfair” treatment of Depp and many stars stepped out to defend him. Many fans, friends, and co-stars defended him and what was shocking was that his previous lovers and wives stepped up to speak for him. Here are some of the stars who stepped up to defend Johnny Depp on his lawsuits against Amber Heard.

1. J.K. Rowling
J.K. Rowling is a famous writer, and even though you are not a fan of books, you sure are familiar with her masterpiece, the Harry Potter series. Her works on the series escalated her name to the top and even made her one of the richest and most influential writers today. 

2. Winona Ryder
Perhaps one of the most shocking faces to see in the line of those who defended Johnny was Winona Ryder, his ex-fiancee. Winona had been engaged to Johnny during their four-year relationship in the 1990s, a pair that had been the center of admiration during their time. She wrote that she was aware of the allegations against his ex-lover, and that she knew him very well, counting their relationship as one of the most significant in her life. “I understand that it is very important that I speak from my own experience, as I obviously was not there during his marriage to Amber, but, from my experience, which was so wildly different, I was absolutely shocked, confused and upset when I heard the accusations against him,” the Stranger Things actress said. 

3. Vanessa Paradis
Johnny Depp has been involved with many actresses throughout his career, he is indeed a very handsome and career-driven man after all. But if there’s someone whom he lasted more than a decade with, it’s the mother of his two kids, renowned French actress Vanessa Paradis. Johnny and Vanessa were in a relationship for 14 years, and separated just before he and Amber were together. 

4. Javier Bardem
Although the statements previously given by his ex-lovers and many of his friends and co-stars had a huge bearing on the case,

Johnny Depp sued Heard and News Group Newspapers (NGN) based on the accusations leveled against him and he still lost the case.

2020 has not been an easy year for anyone especially not for Johnny Depp. From his loss against the high-profile libel case involving the Sun and his ex-wife Amber Heard, one can say that Depp has really been in an intense battle throughout the year. However one thing that is looking good for Depp is the support that he has been receiving from millions, even including the support of some big name celebrities. For quite some time people were slowly starting to believe Amber Heard but that was only until an audio was leaked that quickly made people say she was the guilty one in this situation. There are so many scandals in the celebrity world but this is one that is causing quite the uproar as people are striving to bring justice to Johnny Depp. Allow us to break down the details of the scandal, but also provide you with a list of those celebrities who are supporting Depp during this time. 

Could it actually be true that Johnny Depp is the one who is innocent in this entire situation? Why would Amber Heard spread and display such false allegations about him? If Johnny Depp truly is innocent then, will Amber Heard be at risk of losing her status? Is there any way for her to defend herself after the audios that have been leaked?

One would think that following the release of the Aquaman 2 movie title, Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom, that fans would get excited about it all, however that isn't exactly the case here. Ever since the absolute war that started between Johnny Depp and Amber Heard, it seems that there is constantly one thing after another that is taking place. When Johnny Depp was originally fired from the Pirates of the Caribbean series and lost his role as Captain Jack Sparrow along with his role with Warner bros, individuals following the case were hoping that the same thing would happen to Amber Heard, but that doesn’t seem to be true. Although fans strived to get Amber Heard cut from the beginning of this case, it was a bit tough however with the release of the new Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom title, the #FireAmberHeard movement seems to have made its return.

The FBI Is Coming For Amber Heard - BREAKING! - Justice (Finally?!) For Johnny Depp

https://youtu.be/QR9_W4jVEcQ

The various court cases involving Johnny Depp and Amber Heard have been all
over the news over the last several months and still it is unclear who's right and
who's wrong. But this time there's never-seen-before evidence: body cam
footage from the Los Angeles police department (LAPD) officers who
responded to the 911 call and this evidence seems to change the compilation of
the case.
Make sure you stay till the end to see the final downfall of Amber Heard. This
time she is exposed for real. So, what was on the bodycam footage and why it
could change the whole case.
Nobody expected this was coming but Johnny Depp's attorneys claim that
never-before-seen body cam footage from the Los Angeles police department
(LAPD) officers who responded to the second of two 911 calls proves that
Johnny Depp did not have the violent altercation with his ex-wife! Moreover, it
proves that Amber Heard lied about the alleged brawl that took place in May
2016.
However, it's not the first time that Amber Heard lied. Let’s look back at the
following things: donating the entirety of the divorce settlement money to a
children’s charity, an abuse story that she stole from her former colleague, the
‘dogs story’, never hitting Johnny Depp, and many other things. Amber Heard
lied about all of these things while under oath in the UK high courts. Now
there’s even more evidence that she lied.
And now, ahead of Johnny Depp's upcoming $50 million defamation lawsuit
against his ex-wife, which will take place in Virginia in April 2022, the actor's
lawyers are revealing depositions from the officers and body camera footage
from them and the attorneys are claiming that cops do not support Amber
Heard's allegations.
Giving testimony, Amber Heard claimed that Johnny Depp hit her in the face
with a phone and tore out clumps of her hair in an extended altercation that took
place throughout their shared home at the time. Amber Heard and her friend,
Rocky Pennington, both gave depositions about the incident and each of them

described the scene as a violent mess. Rocky Pennington described it as, ""They
have a big kitchen island in the middle of the kitchen and on there, there's
candles and like fruit and, you know, glass, like jars and vases and things like
that. And he just was hitting everything with the wine bottle, just smashing it all
off. So there was fruit on the floor and baskets and, you know, glass bottles and
flowers.""
Amber Heard's description was, ""We have huge heavy silver candlesticks,
candelabra sticks. Those were on the floor broken. Baskets of fruit that we had
on the kitchen island. There ... fruit everywhere. Baskets on the ground. The
containers holding the spoons and forks, kitchen utensils, those were spilled. He
broke a lot of glass things that left glass on the floor ... when he walked out into
the hallway, you could see wine spilled all over the ground and wine on the
walls and ... and so I knew that at least he had gone through there and was like
sloshing wine anywhere.""
Right now we have a chance to take a look at what really happened that night!
...
And now I want to know your opinion of the matter. Do you think this evidence
will help Johnny Depp to prove that he is not the ab*ser? And do you think
Amber Heard will continue to put up the fight? Let me know your opinion in the

The FBI Is Coming For Amber Heard - BREAKING! - Justice (Finally?!) For Johnny Depp

https://youtu.be/QR9_W4jVEcQ

The various court cases involving Johnny Depp and Amber Heard have been all
over the news over the last several months and still it is unclear who's right and
who's wrong. But this time there's never-seen-before evidence: body cam
footage from the Los Angeles police department (LAPD) officers who
responded to the 911 call and this evidence seems to change the compilation of
the case.
Make sure you stay till the end to see the final downfall of Amber Heard. This
time she is exposed for real. So, what was on the bodycam footage and why it
could change the whole case.
Nobody expected this was coming but Johnny Depp's attorneys claim that
never-before-seen body cam footage from the Los Angeles police department
(LAPD) officers who responded to the second of two 911 calls proves that
Johnny Depp did not have the violent altercation with his ex-wife! Moreover, it
proves that Amber Heard lied about the alleged brawl that took place in May
2016.
However, it's not the first time that Amber Heard lied. Let’s look back at the
following things: donating the entirety of the divorce settlement money to a
children’s charity, an abuse story that she stole from her former colleague, the
‘dogs story’, never hitting Johnny Depp, and many other things. Amber Heard
lied about all of these things while under oath in the UK high courts. Now
there’s even more evidence that she lied.
And now, ahead of Johnny Depp's upcoming $50 million defamation lawsuit
against his ex-wife, which will take place in Virginia in April 2022, the actor's
lawyers are revealing depositions from the officers and body camera footage
from them and the attorneys are claiming that cops do not support Amber
Heard's allegations.
Giving testimony, Amber Heard claimed that Johnny Depp hit her in the face
with a phone and tore out clumps of her hair in an extended altercation that took
place throughout their shared home at the time. Amber Heard and her friend,
Rocky Pennington, both gave depositions about the incident and each of them

described the scene as a violent mess. Rocky Pennington described it as, ""They
have a big kitchen island in the middle of the kitchen and on there, there's
candles and like fruit and, you know, glass, like jars and vases and things like
that. And he just was hitting everything with the wine bottle, just smashing it all
off. So there was fruit on the floor and baskets and, you know, glass bottles and
flowers.""
Amber Heard's description was, ""We have huge heavy silver candlesticks,
candelabra sticks. Those were on the floor broken. Baskets of fruit that we had
on the kitchen island. There ... fruit everywhere. Baskets on the ground. The
containers holding the spoons and forks, kitchen utensils, those were spilled. He
broke a lot of glass things that left glass on the floor ... when he walked out into
the hallway, you could see wine spilled all over the ground and wine on the
walls and ... and so I knew that at least he had gone through there and was like
sloshing wine anywhere.""
Right now we have a chance to take a look at what really happened that night!
...
And now I want to know your opinion of the matter. Do you think this evidence
will help Johnny Depp to prove that he is not the ab*ser? And do you think
Amber Heard will continue to put up the fight? Let me know your opinion in the

Johnny had requested for an appeal to open up the case, which last week was denied by the judges. This challenge that Johnny offered was rejected by Lord Justice Underhill and Lord Justice Dingemans with their reasoning being that they felt going through the case a second time has a high chance of turning out just like the first one.

Depp has been denied the chance to stand up in the libel case against the newspaper as well as one of its journalists. Even with him having proof of him being the victim of abuse by Amber Heard, Johnny was facing the brunt. 

Lord Justice Underhill has also stated that it is hard to convince the jury to vote for his side of the case due to the fact that purely factual questions were not enough to turn the case around.

Amber had promised to give away the divorce settlement of 7 million dollars that she had received from Johnny Depp, to two associations one being the ACLU and the other being the Children’s Hospital, Los Angeles. 

The truth about this came out when Johnny’s team did some digging and found out that she hadn’t donated the money and only had contributed $100,000 towards the organizations. 

Amber has refuted back that she would pay off the donations in time and that all the money that she had, had gone into the lawsuit case, defending herself. But Johnny also did say that the money that she got was being used to sway the judge towards her favour, which is probably what happened. After knowing her nature, it is quite hard to think of her otherwise. 

Sadly, Johnny cannot go back and fend for himself this time. This is due to the fact that the same crime cannot be tried twice and thus the newspapers have taken a deep breath due to their narrow escape from the case getting messier.

In fact, it was the perfect press strategy. Looking at the situation holistically, the overall benefit that Amber has is much higher now. But why? Well, once one rules you out from being the winner of the case, it is hard for other and judged to not agree with his side of the case too.

What did The Sun have to say about this after the verdict was out?
First of all, they were pretty glad that they got out of such a rut of a situation. Secondly, the attorney from The Sun had stated that the winning of the was a big deal as it was a true representation of how strong Amber is to stand up to the face of Mr Depp. 

This whole situation according to them stood as a great example for those suffering from domestic violence and that they are being heard and must be strong enough to stand up for their rights. 

This libel trial of the century had 12 files of evidence that were looked into with evidence also been taken from around 30 witnesses. The  does not wish to proceed on with this case and is hoping this to be the final end to this prolonged case. 

During the first case that he was involved with, the loss that he endured cost him a major chunk of his career. Two of the biggest roles he was holding at that point in time, one being the role of Jack Sparrow from the Pirates of the Caribbean and Gellert Grindelwald from the Fantastic Beasts franchise, both went down the drain after his loss. 

No one wanted to work with him and ruin the reputation of working with an individual who was involved in domestic abuse. 

The only thing left to look forward to is Depp’s defamation lawsuit that would take place in the United States of America. How that would play out and when it would happen is quite unpredictable at this point in time. 

The pandemic has made things all the more worse by dragging out the events of the case. The case that was to be heard out at in April this year, has been postponed to May next year, which is quite a lot of time.

Joelle Rich from Shilling Partners in London has spoken up on behalf of Johnny Depp stating that he still has hopes of winning. In fact, he still thinks that the in the US may actually see things from his perspective and that he may actually be proved not guilty. amber heard aquaman 2 jason momoa clevver news informoverload amber heard elon musk viral vision

After Amber Heard pledged to donate her 7 million dollar divorce settlement to the ACLU Johnny Depp’s lawyers argued that she never followed through with it.

When it comes to the case between Johnny Depp and Amber Heard, it’d be VERY easy to go and say that Amber Heard is winning due to Depp’s lose of both the Libel case and the appeal that was to follow. And while he has made headway, many note that he’s losing a lot of ground despite the evidence he has that. You might even think that he’s a bit alone out there in the world, but he’s honestly not. Because many people have stood up for him and defended him against Amber Heard. Allow us to show you them.

Hey everyone! Welcome back. This video has all new audio that was secretly recorded by Amber Heard immediately following an incident in Australia on March 8, 2015, in which evidence has been shown to the courts to prove she severed the end of Johnny Depp's finger. However, she has not only now claims he physically assaulted her but also has recently added sexual assault to her claims. 

Some of this audio was recently reported by the Daily Mail but with what I feel was an inaccurate transcript by Amber Heard, which she submitted in 2016, along with the audio. 

Please do not take the audio combined with my edits and pass them off as your own. That would be greatly appreciated.

investigation by the LAPD for perjury concerning the 2016 incident in which
Depp allegedly hit his then-wife in the face. For now, Amber Heard is trying to
get the case dismissed officially.
I’m going to break it down for you, but before we start, hit that subscribe button
and make sure you stay till the end to know if the game is over for Amber
Heard.
After Johnny Deepp's defeat in the British High Court last year, his legal team
has plans to appeal. But this is more difficult than it seems because Amber
Heard’s legal team has tried to get the U.S.-based lawsuit dismissed, arguing
that the findings in the U.K. libel suit should be adopted. As for Johnny Depp’s
lawyer? He’s calling it a “hail Mary.”
Apparently, Amber Heard's legal team doesn't want to give up without a fight
and they've filed a motion to stay discovery on the defamation claims and also a
memorandum in support of her motion for leave. Her team believes that due to
the libel case results, which found in favor of The Sun after that outlet called
Johnny Depp a “wife beater,” that the judgment rendered should be applicable
in the US as well. The motion reads:
With the finality of the Judgment, rendered after Mr. Depp presented his best
evidence and arguments on the exact same factual issues assessed here, Mr.
Depp should be precluded from seeking yet another bite of the apple, where he
has fully adjudicated his dispute and lost. Because of the UK Judgment, the
entire world may now say, forever, that Mr. Depp is a ‘wife beater’ and has
committed at least 12 acts of domestic violence against Amber Heard, causing
her to be in fear for her life. In short, the UK Judgement, now final, permits this
court to end the litigation.
According to Johnny Depp’s lawyer, Benjamin Chew, however, this is not the
first time Amber Heard’s legal team has tried to get the $50 million defamation

lawsuit dismissed. He noted (via Courthouse News) that this is just “the latest
Hail Mary” from Amber Heard’s legal team and that her team has tried to get
the defamation lawsuit thrown out three times over the past two years. Johnny
Depp's team believes Amber Heard's Op Ed in the Washington Post was
defamatory and cost the actor work.
But what about the US? We will talk about that in a second, but now, make sure
you hit the like button if you enjoy this video. It seems like the cases are moving
forward in Virginia. However, they have been expensive, with deposition
requests and more coming from both sides. Both Amber Heard and Johnny
Johnny are digging for additional information that can be used against each
other. Amber Heard, for example, has been looking into Disney and what the
company knew about Johnny Depp’s actions and behavior during his time on
the Pirates of the Caribbean films. Speaking of Johnny Depp, he has asserted
Amber Heard has lied on several occasions, including stealing her ex assistant's
s*xual as*ult story, and saying she would give their divorce settlement to
charity but didn’t. In addition, Amber Heard had asserted Johnny Depp was
violent against her but police body cam footage allegedly showed otherwise.
But here is a very interesting moment. According to the police officers who
arrived on the scene (when Amber Heard’s friends accidentally called 911
twice), there was no visual evidence that a crime had taken place at all. 
...
The court date for the main defamation date is in April 2022 and we will make
sure to be the first ones to deliver the latest news to you. So stay tuned and don’t
forget to hit the subscribe button not to miss all the details about Amber Heard
and Johnny Depp’s case. Thanks for watching this video, see you in the next

Amber Heard just suffered her biggest loss in court to Johnny Depp! She is stunned. This will completely change the legal battle moving forward.

With the initial court date being pushed back, Johnny Depp and Amber Heard have been given some more time in order to gather more evidence for their individual cases. For quite some time, the two were firing evidence at each other in order to win in court. 

Ever since the recent release of the footage of the LAPD officers from the penthouse night of Amber Heard and Johnny Depp, things have not been looking all too bright for Amber Heard. Her team has been working tirelessly in order to back up her side, however Johnny Depp seems to have made the attempt to strike back.

The Me Too Movement is a social movement that was adopted to advocate for females who underwent sexual violence to talk about their experiences. The goal of this movement has been to show the survivors of sexual violence that they are not alone.
 For the past years, this movement has helped to shine a light on the sexual violence taking place worldwide.
When Amber Heard spoke about her alleged sexual abuse, she used this movement to ensure her story was heard. Many people supported her and showed her love for speaking out.
However, as the court battle between Amber Heard and Johnny Depp continues, it is becoming more evident that Amber was the actual abuser in the relationship.
 If this is true, then it means that Amber took advantage of the Me Too platform to win her case.

While some celebrities prefer living a quiet life away from the public, others just have so many scandals following them. In this video, we are going to talk about Johnny Depp and Amber Heard, who have been on each other’s throats ever since they split up and how Amber Heard might be facing jail time for one mistake she made in all this.

With the initial court date being pushed back, Johnny Depp and Amber Heard have been given some more time in order to gather more evidence for their individual cases. For quite some time, the two were firing evidence at each other in order to win in court. 

Ever since the recent release of the footage of the LAPD officers from the penthouse night of Amber Heard and Johnny Depp, things have not been looking all too bright for Amber Heard. Her team has been working tirelessly in order to back up her side, however Johnny Depp seems to have made the attempt to strike back.

Johnny Depp’s Lawyer QUESTIONS Amber Heard’s Attorney about OP ED in accusations against Johnny Depp and ACLU donation that was supposed to be paid by Amber Heard. This could another case of defamation or fraud. Let's break it down in today's video.

With the initial court date being pushed back, Johnny Depp and Amber Heard have been given some more time in order to gather more evidence for their individual cases. For quite some time, the two were firing evidence at each other in order to win in court. 

Ever since the recent release of the footage of the LAPD officers from the penthouse night of Amber Heard and Johnny Depp, things have not been looking all too bright for Amber Heard. Her team has been working tirelessly in order to back up her side, however Johnny Depp seems to have made the attempt to strike back.

In this analysis, I discuss the infamous San Francisco meeting after Amber Heard filed a restraining order against and alleged domestic violence by Johnny Depp. She asked Depp to meet up secretly in San Francisco despite the restraining order application. 

(I focus on the texts that both sent to mutual friend Christian Carino. I think I left out a bit of Johnny Depp's account where he told someone else--not Carino I think--that Amber had asked him to hold and comfort her. Please let me know where I can find that account by Depp so I can update this video.)

Things appear to be going from bad to worse for Amber Heard as new revelations continue to appear on tabloids detailing how untrue most of her claims about her ex-husband were. Since last year when Johnny Depp decided to launch a series of law suits against her and The Sun Newspapers for defamation of character, her career has not remained the same. She used her allegations to cancel and ruin Depp's career, but now, karma has come full circle. Johnny Depp has come out to speak against Amber and her lies.

Just to give you a quick recap, Johnny Depp and his ex-wife split after been married for only a year and Amber Heard went on to claim that the Pirates of The Carribean actor had been violent towards her while in the relationship. She gave interviews across different media outlets including the Washington Post and The Sun and her story ruined Depp's reputation and affected his career negatively. Then came the publication by the Sun calling Johnny Depp names all based on Amber’s story. This was the final straw as Johnny Depp decided to take NGN (the owners of the Sun Newspaper) to court with a defamation lawsuit. He also filed a suit against Amber seeking damages for ruining his reputation.

Amber Heard opens up about losing parts in films in the wake of making claims of maltreatment against Johnny Depp, Amber Heard in an article shared what opening up about the maltreatment she had encountered meant for her profession.

 Amber Heard, who was most as of late seen in Aquaman, has composed a paper for The Washington Post, distributed on 18 December, about the result of blaming Johnny Depp for abusive behavior at home. Heard in the article, composed that she ""felt the full power of our way of life's anger for ladies who stand up"".

Aquaman 2 is correct now expected to hit theaters in 2022, so creation may be starting soon. There has been a lot of speculation about Amber Heard's part in Aquaman 2 lately. Unsubstantiated reports keep on appearing to be on the web and across online media requesting the performer isn't most likely going to return as the hero Mera in Warner Bros.' spin-off of James Wan's 2018 superhuman hit, and some have suggested that she had been superseded. Regardless, Heard says such cases are all in all wet.

""I'm truly amped up for the proportion of fan love and the proportion of fan appreciation that Aquaman has gotten and that it has procured such a ton of energy for Aquaman and Mera that it suggests we'll be returning,"" Heard tells EW. ""I'm so anxious to film that."" Heard added that the creation wants to get in progress eventually in 2021. In light of everything, Aquaman 2 isn't yet legitimately greenlit by the studio, its cast isn't asserted and it's anything but a revealed starting date.

Hannibal performer Mads Mikkelsen is by and by in converses with accept power over the piece of dull wizard Gellert Grindelwald. Depp will evidently still get paid for the looming Fantastic Beasts 3 despite having quite recently recorded one scene. She shared that she needed to frequently change her telephone number since she used to get passing dangers. Heard likewise composed that she seldom got out of her loft yet when she did, she was followed by paparazzi just as camera drones.

On May 23, 2016, Heard petitioned for legal separation from Depp and furthermore got a brief controlling request against the Oscar-designated entertainer. She claimed that Depp had genuinely manhandled her during their relationship, and said it had been generally while affected by medicine or liquor. She asserted that at the hour of seeking legal separation, an event had as of late occurred during which Depp tossed his telephone at her, leaving her with a wounded face.

In December 2018, Heard wrote an op-ed for The Washington Post saying she was mishandled, during which she talked about the treatment of women in homegrown maltreatment cases. Inside the opinion piece, Heard expressed: ""I turned into a name addressing homegrown maltreatment, and that I felt the total power of our way of life's fierceness for women who stand up."" Depp himself was never referenced by name.
Depp's lawyers say that Killackey's account proves that Heard was motivated by money to talk out against her ex-husband. In legal documents obtained by The Blast, Killackey portrayed a few 'very threatening' discussions with both Heard and her dad after he moved toward them about paying for the fixes to their vehicles.

Heard cravings to smash Depp's defamation guarantee by showing her charges that her ex is a boozer with addictions to drugs who consistently kicked her, beat her and, once in a while, was furious to the point that she passed out. Depp denied those allegations and insisted that Heard was the violent one in their relationship, claiming that he needed to possess his finger surgically reattached after she hurled a vodka bottle at him. 

About Amber Heard's separation, Amber Heard and Johnny Depp's case has been all the rage for a long time now. The couple is taking on a legitimate conflict to separate and has asserted actual maltreatment charges against each other. Following the genuine abuse case, Johnny Depp has been killed from his part as Grindelwald in the looming Fantastic Beasts 3 film. Devotees of Johnny Depp have made a couple of petitions online for the ejection of Amber Heard from the Aquaman foundation. Twitter is stacked up with fans who are against Amber Heard continuing as Mera clevver news celebrity news amber heard loses amber heard aquaman 2

The increasingly unhinged story of itinerant journalist Paul Kemp (Johnny Depp). Tired of the noise and madness of New York and the crushing conventions of late Eisenhower-era America, Kemp travels to the pristine island of Puerto Rico to write for a local San Juan newspaper run by the downtrodden editor Lotterman (Richard Jenkins). Adopting the rum-soaked lifestyle of the late '50s version of Hemingway's ""The Lost Generation,"" Paul soon becomes entangled with a very attractive American woman, Chenault (Amber Heard) and her fiancee Sanderson (Aaron Eckhart), a businessman involved in shady property development deals. It is within this world that Kemp ultimately discovers his true voice as a writer and integrity as a man. The Rum Diary  trailer, official 2011 movie trailer, is presented in full HD 1080p high resolution.

For years now, Johnny Depp and his ex-wife Amber Heard have been clawing back and forth to go and get an advantage over the other in the numerous cases that have been filed by them at each other. Johnny Depp for example filed a Defamation Suit against Heard for $50 million and she filed a countersuit worth $100 million. That case is still going on and has been delayed until 2022 due to the pandemic pushing back scheduling. But even though that’s going on, there are some things that aren’t adding up in Heard’s defense. We’ll break it down for you. Be sure to like the video and subscribe to the channel!

Johnny Depp finally speaks on how these court cases have affected Amber Heard's career. Let's just say he does not feel too bad for here. 

Here is a look at Amber Heard and all the things that she’s done to Johnny Depp, to fans, and more that have painted her in a more monstrous light that’ll no doubt end her career. How much longer do you think it’ll take for Hollywood to realize who Amber Heard truly is?

With the initial court date being pushed back, Johnny Depp and Amber Heard have been given some more time in order to gather more evidence for their individual cases. For quite some time, the two were firing evidence at each other in order to win in court. 

Ever since the recent release of the footage of the LAPD officers from the penthouse night of Amber Heard and Johnny Depp, things have not been looking all too bright for Amber Heard. Her team has been working tirelessly in order to back up her side, however Johnny Depp seems to have made the attempt to strike back.

Johnny and Amber’s love life and married life were not as appealing as their dramatic divorce is. 
Depp has steadily denied the claims of abuse by Amber Heard but was once again withheld approval to petition the court's ruling in March 2021. Court of Appeal jurists said the original hearing ""was full and fair"" and that the trial judge ""gave thorough reasons for his conclusions which have not been determined even arguably to be revoked by any error of approach or errors of law.""

Johnny and Amber’s love life and married life were not as appealing as their dramatic divorce is. 
Depp has steadily denied the claims of abuse by Amber Heard but was once again withheld approval to petition the court's ruling in March 2021. Court of Appeal jurists said the original hearing ""was full and fair"" and that the trial judge ""gave thorough reasons for his conclusions which have not been determined even arguably to be revoked by any error of approach or errors of law.""

Why did the couple get a divorce?
With Amber Heard’s beauty and Johnny’s amazing personality, talent, and success we were almost alluded to believe that this super couple may actually work. But if even the strongest couples like Brangelina can break up, this is probably next to nothing in front of them. 

So as the cliche series of events of any regular Hollywood love story goes, the couple were in love, dated for a while, and BOOM! married in a few years. But the year following came with quite a quick divorce leaving the couple and the showbiz world with nothing but pure messy drama!

And here we are, suckers for drama, trying to keep up with the latest gossip on what this couple is up to next.

What were the crazy events that took place after the divorce?
Honestly, the details of the events that took place after the divorce took so many turns that even Sherlock Holmes would’ve been confused, resulting in him taking quite a long time to unravel the truth. For starters, the divorce involved Depp paying Amber a whopping 7 million.

For those of you who do not know who Mera is, Mera is the female protagonist of the DC billion-dollar grossing movie Aquaman which was such a huge success that Warner Bros. declared the news of there being a sequel almost immediately. 

But all this happened in 2018 when things for Amber were all playing out in her favor. Fast forward to 2020, the pandemic wasn’t the only concern for her as 2020 brought out so much evidence against her in the 50 million dollar filed by Johnny Depp that she was trapped, not knowing what step to take next. I think by now it is safe enough to say that this woman will stoop to any level to get things done her way. 

So back to her Aquaman debut in 2018, due to the film being quite a hit, Warner Bros. didn’t want to delay in releasing the sequel which is said to be out in 2022. But the famous petitions against her along with her making constant headlines have left us to wonder if she actually still has a spot on the cast list. For the sake of justice, we truly hope not just Warner Bros, but the entire showbiz industry thinks twice before casting her.

Has she been getting roles in the film industry considering the blow-up of the scandal?
Unlike Johnny being rejected for movies he has made his legacy with, Amber has been scoring quite a few films. In fact, she has a mini-series on Netflix currently running as well as her role in Aquaman 2.

So yes as far as we know she will be coming back on the big screens next year, but her time on screen may be cut short so as to not infuriate the fans further. But hey, did you guys hear about the rumors of Emilia Clarke being a suitable replacement for Amber on the cast?! 

What has Amber got to say about her actions and this situation as a whole?
The woman has been seen laughing it off on various occasions. If she is not holding up a strong facade, she is busy coming to her defense with ever-ready tales of lies. 
A while back she was seen getting frustrated at how the public has been going against her, causing her to reach an infuriated state hence causing her to state that what is being said is not fair and that no one could take the role of Mera from her. 

Let us keep all this aside and head on to talking about Jason Momoa. How does he fit into all of this? Aquaman is Jason Momoa! The hunk is known to have been the main reason why the first Aquaman movie was such a big hit and Warner Bros. is counting on him to do them proud with its sequel too. In fact, the man is said to have brought the comics to life with his acting which truly made the movie gain tons of fans. amber heard aquaman 2 celebrity news clevver news amber heard fired

Elon Musk just keeps getting dragged back into the Johnny Depp Amber Heard celeb drama. Elon Musk, Johnny Depp and Amber Heard are back on the frontlines of celebrity news. Amber Heard just had a baby girl and rumors are swirling on who the baby's father is. 

Many are saying it is Johnny Depp. Some are saying is Elon Musk himself. Elon Musk and Amber Heard are past lovers and rumors are swirling that Elon Musk paid Amber Heard's 7 million donation to the ACLU back in 2016. So these two have a history together.

But no public statements have been made in this regard by either Elon Musk, Johnny Depp or Amber Heard. So no one knows for sure yet. In this video, we breakdown the story in detail. This celebrity drama goes down while the Johnny Depp Amber Heard civil court case rages on.

With the initial court date being pushed back, Johnny Depp and Amber Heard have been given some more time in order to gather more evidence for their individual cases. For quite some time, the two were firing evidence at each other in order to win in court. 

Ever since the recent release of the footage of the LAPD officers from the penthouse night of Amber Heard and Johnny Depp, things have not been looking all too bright for Amber Heard. Her team has been working tirelessly in order to back up her side, however Johnny Depp seems to have made the attempt to strike back.

Jason Momoa is a name that is buzzing and has been buzzing in the world of showbiz for quite some time. In fact, when Aquaman was released earlier in the year 2018, he was the only talk of Hollywood! 

Due to Aquaman’s major success, soon after its release, the second sequel to the movie was announced to be premiered in the year 2022. Unfortunately, with the Me Too movement targeting so many A-listers, one of the cast members was accused of being a part of this bandwagon. Any guesses on who fell off the wagon and joined in amongst the list of abusers? Yes, it was Amber Heard!

Amber Heard has been making headlines regularly for almost 2 years now, especially after her divorce from Johnny Depp. Initially, people assumed her to be the poor victim in the chaotic scenario she had going on with Johnny Depp. At one point, we were pretty convinced that she was the victim after she posted her pictures of the scars that she had obtained due to being a victim of domestic violence. 
 
What were Amber’s claims?

Amber Heard proved to be the biggest victim of the year, with her constant rants on social media as well as her claiming Johnny Depp to be an evil man with anger issues. She kept throwing out lies until one day Depp was forced to sue her, hence causing the famous chaotic court case to make repeated headlines.

How did Ambers Claims backfire?
 
Johnny Depp was proven innocent to his ex-wife’s claims after a leaked conversation between the two was released, proving that in fact, it was Johnny Depp who was being victimized. This surely didn’t save the mess he was in but made the likes of big platforms such as Disney apologize to him for believing the allegations.

How did this news worsen?

The Me Too movement was trending and each day a new celeb was being called out for inappropriate behaviour of misconduct with the co-workers, especially the female ones. Due to this being embedded in the minds of all, Depp was the most likely candidate to get abuser-bashed for his immoral actions.

Due to her alleged accusations, Johnny Depp’s career was quite miserable. In fact, the production teams that loved working with his massive talent started to reject his role in the movies. And all this was due to the fault of Amber and her bunch of lies. Imagine not having Jack Sparrow in the next Pirates of the Caribbean sequel!

What’s the big question now?

What’s racing across everyone’s mind is what does Amber Heard’s co-star, Jason Momoa, have to say about this? 

As you may be aware, Warner Bros just like all other entertainment entities, have the contents of the contract that they sign with the actors, strictly specifying them to follow privacy protocols, leaving the actors with little to nothing left to say about what goes on with the production of their movie as well as any other activities that take place under the roof of the Warner Bros. 

Jason Momoa has been adhering to the protocol and has not stated anything about the scandal his co-star was involved in. It shows that he doesn’t care about this blow -up or change in the cast, or that he has been asked by Warner Bros. to keep this situation on the low.

But, was Momoa and Heard compatible in real life as much as they seemed on screen?

Rumor has it that the Momoa and Heard were not as compatible as they seemed on the screen. With them being actors from two different worlds, it is sure to be quite a clash in the studios. But others state that they were actually good together since they were complete opposites and that opposites attract. Even though they seem great together on the red carpet, always having fun, the truth behind this fact is still left unknown!

Would Momoa’s word and stance on this scenario change the fate of who plays the role of Mera?

Most probably, yes. Without Jason, there is no Aquaman. In fact, the entire success behind Aquaman was 90% due to Jason Momoa’s efforts in making the storyline as lively. Without him, reaching this milestone would have been highly impossible. On a serious note, it’s highly possible that rather than risking their biggest asset, Warner Bros. would not sacrifice their king for the sake of Amber!

In this short video, I share my personal thoughts and feelings on Elon Musk's role in the Depp vs. Heard situation, and I share with Mr. Musk some things that I wish I could say to him in person. 

Just felt like getting a few things off my chest. This is just an informal quick take (or a mini-rant, I'm not sure which), so let me know your thoughts!  I felt inspired to engage in catharsis (with a bit of sarcastic fun thrown in ;).

It follows her testimony yesterday - where she alleged Johnny Depp had accused her of having affairs with a string of Hollywood stars, as well as threatening to 'kill her' on multiple occasions. But what has the reaction been stateside? And what else can we expect to come from the trial? Sam Rubin is joining us with all the details.

The way the footage was filmed without his knowledge, her encouragement of him to vocalise his anger, and the way the footage was cut, all adds to impression that Amber Heard is creating a smear campaign around Johnny Depp.

Renowned actor Johnny Depp and young actress Amber Heard met in 2011 while producing the film ""The Rum Diary"". The two actually played a couple on-screen for this film, roles that even included a steamy make-out scene. From this point, it became very clear that the two were interested in each other romantically. Although they kept it quiet for some time, Johnny Depp and Amber Heard eventually admitted to being in a relationship.

This relationship came to light in 2014 when Johnny Depp began wearing a woman's engagement ring - a clear signal he was off the market. The story goes that Johnny Depp bought Amber Heard the engagement ring but it was too big to fit her finger. So, he bought her a new one, and decided to wear the original engagement ring on his own hand. Just a few months later, they would have a private wedding.

Johnny Depp and Amber Heard seemed to share a wholesome relationship at first. Depp was always eager to talk about her and they appeared together more often than not. They even appeared at charity events together and seemed to support each other. They started making headlines for the wrong reasons in 2015 when they flew their Yorkshire Terriers into Australia illegally. Amber Heard faced legal repercussions and the couple also released an apology video at this time.

In 2016, things went south as the couple officially filed for a divorce. However, things were just getting started. Just days after the divorce filing, Amber Heard filed for a restraining order, claiming that Johnny Depp had been physically abusive with her. This claim was accompanied by apparent bruises shown in photos, as well as a number of stories from Amber Heard. Johnny Depp, as well as many of his friends, family and exes came to his support saying that he would never get physical with a woman. Furthermore, the stories told by witnesses and the police didn't quite line up with Amber Heard's claims.

Eventually, Amber Heard dropped her claims and the divorce was settled. She was given $7 million in the divorce settlement and donated every cent of it to charity.

Amber Heard wasn't done though - she continued to speak out about domestic abuse and even published an op ed in 2018 that shared more details about her experiences. Johnny Depp responded with a defamation lawsuit, claiming that her actions would directly damage his career and image - AND that her accusations were false! 

This has developed into a number of court proceedings, cases and lawsuits in which both Jonny Depp and Amber Heard have taken the stand and testified on their experiences. More shocking details of their marriage have come out throughout these processes. For example, Johnny Depp reveals that Amber Heard actually cut off his finger by throwing a vodka bottle at him - an injury that kept him from working, as well as had many tragic complications throughout his recovery. Furthermore, Johnny Depp revealed that Amber Heard once pooped on his bed, a move she claimed was a ""practical joke"". 

Despite the evidence seemingly mounting against Amber Heard, Johnny Depp lost his lawsuit against the Sun who claimed he was a ""wife beater"". These ongoings have cost Depp his role in Fantastic Beasts and the Pirates of the Caribbean, as Warner Brothers have distanced themselves from his controversial case. Amber Heard seems to be taking things well, and no announcements have been made about her future films. However, with Aquaman 2 on the horizon, Johnny Depp supporters around the world are petitioning to have Amber Heard removed from the film. Many people see her equally or even more at fault of domestic abuse, and should therefore face the same career repercussions as Johnny Depp.

Amber Heard is scheduled to stand trial in early 2021.

With the initial court date being pushed back, Johnny Depp and Amber Heard have been given some more time in order to gather more evidence for their individual cases. For quite some time, the two were firing evidence at each other in order to win in court. 

Ever since the recent release of the footage of the LAPD officers from the penthouse night of Amber Heard and Johnny Depp, things have not been looking all too bright for Amber Heard. Her team has been working tirelessly in order to back up her side, however Johnny Depp seems to have made the attempt to strike back.

Now it turns out that Amber Heard may have not written the statement or OP ED in accusations against Johnny Depp. This could another case of defamation or fraud. Let's break it down in today's video.

This disgusted me. Amber Heard secretly taped Johnny Depp, trying to catch him as ""the monster"", then leaked PART of the tape to TMZ.  The video clip looked bad out of context with Johnny hurling glasses against the wall. But the full tape has now been released, along with more information about the reason Johnny was angry. Get ready to be mad. Amber Heard is a complete liar.

She said that it originally ate away at her wallet for many years, but she’s hung onto the car regardless. In the above video, Heard is surprised by her husband Johnny Depp, her dad and the show’s cast about getting her car restored. But, they all decide to pull a prank on her first, making her believe her car had been stolen.
